<h2><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Because of my association with the beautiful Canyon of
the Rito de Los Frijoles in Bandelier National Monument,
New Mexico, and because of my deep interest in this Monument,
the loose ends of a story, about the primitive people
who made it their home, have been shaping themselves into
a history beginning in America long before either Spaniards
or Englishmen came to this country.</p>
<p>The material is based upon the work of many students
who have done actual research in Frijoles Canyon and adjacent
areas. It is a combination of legendary material, observation,
speculation, scientific fact and logic. The text in
the following pages is not presented as absolute and unquestionable
fact in its entirety, and the author does not intend
that it be interpreted that way. There will be some, no doubt,
who, for the sake of convenience, will mutter indiscreetly
about its content&mdash;that it isn&rsquo;t scientific&mdash;as if the book had
been intended for the exact scientist. Rather, it is meant for
the lay reader who visits the Monument area and who
would like to understand some of the customs and ways of
life of its ancient inhabitants. This ancient world of the cliff
dweller of New Mexico is recreated for the visitor through
the firing of his imagination by an understanding of the
arch&aelig;ological facts revealed here.</p>
<p>Until a great amount of research is done, a more accurate
account of the arch&aelig;ology of this area will not be had.
But because of the thousands of visitors to Bandelier National
Monument each year, and their interest in its ancient
inhabitants, this popular narrative is presented. Throughout
the text are many uncommon words and names used
frequently in New Mexico. The reader will find a helpful
list of these with simplified pronunciations and meanings
at the end of the book.</p>

<br />Some Twenty Years Ago</h2>
<p>It has been some twenty odd years since I, as a child, first
peered over the north rim of Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>. This was
not so long ago when one thinks of the hundreds of
others, still alive, who passed this way before me. I do not
pretend to be an ancient but the number of individuals who
saw the Frijoles in those days are microscopic when compared
with the multitudes who have seen it since. There is
not sufficient room here to discuss those who knew the place
in the early days, long before my time, except to mention
such personages as Adolph <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a>, Charles Lummis, H.
P. Mera, Edgar L. Hewett, Sylvanus G. Morley, A. V. Kidder,
Jesse Nusbaum, Kenneth Chapman and many others
who have distinguished themselves in the field of arch&aelig;ology
or related fields. They all knew the place in its infancy, so
to speak, and have contributed their share to the story of
primitive <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indians who lived in the Valley of the Rito
de Los Frijoles in times anterior to the coming of the
Spanish.</p>
<p>As I remember it, there was a short-cut road into the
Frijoles, little more than a cow path which left the Albuquerque-Santa Fe highway
just on top of <a class="gloss" href="#g_LaBajada">La Bajada</a> Hill. It
must have been fifteen miles across La Bajada <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> west to
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. Over the rolling hills of mesa-land the gears
of our car ground a good part of the way in low until the
little settlement of Buckman on the banks of the Rio Grande
was reached. A man by this name, Buckman, used to cut and
haul timber from the high potreros; he built a sawmill, and
also a narrow bridge across the river here. It was a rickety
old bridge with planks for runners but we got across. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
winding, bumpy road led us up a steep climb from the Rio Grande to the forested land extending toward the high
mountains. Once on top the mesa we drove between two of
many high potreros and on into Water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> where the
road followed the narrow valley for a few miles. We crossed
a winding creek several times and drove through green pastures
until the high-walled canyon became narrow.</p>
<p>Presently, the road turned to the left winding up the side
of the mountain. Fortunately it was not muddy or we might
never have made the steep grade. Once on top of the plateau
the road headed south and a little west in the direction of
Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> a few miles distant. We wound through majestic
yellow pines, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinon">pi&ntilde;ons</a> and scrubby junipers. Here the
road turned again and paralleled the Canyon for a few
miles, up and down hills, ever twisting and turning. We
drove to the top of an old trail which might have been used
by ancient Indians some four hundred years ago. I walked
to the brink of the Canyon, my mother constantly reminding
me not to go too near. The height was terrific. It must have
been six hundred feet to the bottom of the gorge&mdash;almost
straight down. It made me dizzy. I had never seen such a
thing before in all my life. It was to me a Hidden Valley and
I wondered why any people wanted to come away out here
to live&mdash;even <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> Indians. Of course, it was awe-inspiring
but I was too young to be inspired.</p>
<p>There were saddle horses at the brink of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>
for folk who couldn&rsquo;t or who were too lazy to walk down
the trail. And then there were benches and tables
underneath the pines for picnickers who wanted to eat
either before they began the long descent into the valley,
or after they returned from it. For years and years people
walked or rode horseback up and down the steep old
trail. Perhaps some never reached the bottom. Individuals
came from all over the world. Some painted, some viewed,
some fished, some wrote and some prayed to God that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
might make it back to the top. Others, enthralled by the
grandeur of the Canyon, desired to cast themselves off its
rim into the mystery of its depth. I myself distinctly remember
climbing down that old winding trail from the north rim.
It seemed that we would never reach the bottom. The trail
was a precipitous one, zigzagging and narrow, to the valley
floor far below.</p>
<p>At a short distance across the narrow Rito we could see a
little stone ranch house surrounded by huge pine trees and
box-elders. A woman was standing on the porch probably
wondering if we were to be guests for the night at the famous
&ldquo;Ten Elder Ranch.&rdquo; But my father and I were fishing for
mountain trout, and, if I remember correctly, it was he who
caught the limit because he was the fisherman, not I. I might
have been included among those unschooled people who had
in their blood simply the desire for &ldquo;pioneering&rdquo; and &ldquo;roughing-it,&rdquo;
but who understood little about what they saw.</p>
<p>This excursion of ours took place when roads in New
Mexico were almost nil. A buckboard would have been better
than an automobile with high pressure tires which blew
out about twice a day. We broke an axle on the way home
and had to spend the night on <a class="gloss" href="#g_LaBajada">La Bajada</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a> between the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> and the highway in what was locally known as
&ldquo;Old Man Pankey&rsquo;s Pastures.&rdquo; The Valley of the Frijoles
impressed me, then a little boy, and, I well remember the
hundreds of smoke-blackened caves hewn out of the soft
cliffs by Indians sometime in the dim past. But I knew not
the significance of these caves. I knew nothing of the story
of how <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> Indians lived four hundred years ago.
They were merely blackened holes to me occupied by a people
about whom I knew little. I remember the ruins of the
big community house. It was located across the little river
from the stone ranch house. I thought it foolish for Indians
to build houses out in the sun when there were so many shade
trees close to the Rito. I now believe that this first visit of my
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
childhood created within me the desire to solve for myself
the questions then arising in my mind concerning the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>.
Since that time hundreds of famous personages have
passed this way: artists, arch&aelig;ologists, doctors, botanists,
psychologists, statesmen, preachers, governors, engineers,
students and romancers, each finding satisfaction in his own
particular line of interest.</p>
<p>Life in this place two decades ago can best be described
by the owner of the old ranch, Mrs. Evelyn C. Frey,
who has made Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> her home for twenty odd
years. She can tell some very interesting stories about the
early days. She knows the country and the trails, the
flowers and the birds; and she still calls folks, who live
thirty miles away, her neighbors. She recalls many lonely
hours spent with her baby in the stillness of the Canyon. She
remembers how the sun would go down over the south cliff
at twelve noon and then how the day would change toward
cold evenings and bitter winter nights. Ofttimes a howling
wind would arise, then followed a calm, and in the morning
a foot of deep snow. And there was no way out of the valley
except over the old north trail. She tells how deer
pranced around in full view, unafraid. Wild turkeys rested
upon the wall behind the old ranch place and could be seen
from her kitchen window. But she was never afraid and said
she knew how to use a six-shooter if she had to. Mrs. Frey
had told me many times, how, after a rough and tiresome
drive from Santa Fe over fire trails, all supplies were packed
on horses and mules and brought down to the floor of the
Canyon.</p>
<p>A heavy pack mule, once upon a time, loaded with
lumber, just didn&rsquo;t make one of the sharp turns in the trail.
It dropped one hundred fifty feet and went to mule heaven,
bumping from first one level to another, lumber and all.
The carcass was left for the scavengers of the air to feast
upon. Mrs. Frey has described how she often bundled her
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
tiny baby up in blankets to protect it from the cold on bitter
winter nights, and, bearing the child in her arms she herself
had swung into the saddle at the top of the old trail. The
narrow path was covered with snow all the way down, and
although she was afraid, the faithful horse had always carried
them safely to their home.</p>
<p>The time came when pack horses were replaced by a
cable-way strung from the north cliff to the floor of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>.
It was a thousand feet long and the tram-car was operated
by a gasoline engine. This was the way supplies were
brought in for the operation of the dude ranch&mdash;even the
winter&rsquo;s supply of wood. It was not until 1933 that the old
trail was abandoned. At this time an automobile road was
blasted from the side of the steep cliff in the lower end of
Frijoles Canyon.</p>
<p>The history, if written, might prove far more interesting
to many people than the prehistory. There would be some
interesting tales to tell about folk and their affairs, but our
main concern is with the prehistory. I do not think I
exaggerate the situation when I say, despite a visitor&rsquo;s interest
or profession, most guests have come to Frijoles to visit
the hundreds of ruins of homes built by the ancestors of
some of our present-day <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indians. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> and
its extensive cliff dwellings and pueblo ruins are well-known
the world over. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Neolithic">Neolithic</a> people, stone age people with implements
of bone and stone and wood, lived here in ancient
times and when they deserted their homes in the cliffs and on
the valley floor, they left one of the most outstanding and
spectacular sites in the southwestern part of America to be
preserved for posterity.</p>

<br />The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indian Meets the White Man</h2>
<p>Could there be, in the Southwest, a man or woman who
has not heard something of the Spanish expeditions
into the New World during the sixteenth century?
And, narrowing it down, about <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coronado">Coronado</a>&rsquo;s famed Seven
Cities of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cibola">Cibola</a> and how they turned out to be six instead
of seven poor little <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> of stone and mud. They are now
reduced to but one called <a class="gloss" href="#g_Zuni">Zu&ntilde;i</a>. <a class="gloss" href="#g_MarcosDeNisa">Marcos de Nisa</a>, a Franciscan
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Friar">friar</a>, had led the little army of conquerors to nothing
here except grief and disappointment in trade for fabulous
stories about gold and silver.</p>
<p>New Mexico was a new country and besides extending
the domain of His Majesty, King Charles, and forcing Christianity
on the Indians, there were many wonders that would
stand investigation. Had it not been for an Indian who was
named <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bigotes">Bigotes</a> by the Spaniards, the conquerors might never
have reached the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> during that expedition.
Bigotes means &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; and his appearance must have
been a sight to His Majesty&rsquo;s soldiers when this half-clad
native came strolling into their camp with a few companions
from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pecos">Pecos</a> far to the east. Unlike most of his kind, Bigotes
wore a long mustache. He had brought buffalo hides to trade
to the Spanish and he persuaded them to visit his country.
It was on August 29, 1540, that the little band pushed out
under the guidance of Bigotes. On September 7 of that year
they reached the Province of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a>, which was between
the present towns of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Albuquerque">Albuquerque</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bernalillo">Bernalillo</a>.</p>
<p>There were twelve Indian villages on the banks of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> within a distance of some fifteen miles or so.
The Rio Grande was described by the Spanish, at that time,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
as large and mighty in a spacious valley two leagues wide.
Although the valley was broad and fertile, the Spanish description
was certainly an over-estimation. Two leagues
equalled five or six miles. They also said that the river froze
so hard that laden animals and carts could cross over it.
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a> was the winter camp of the entire Spanish expedition.
It was here that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coronado">Coronado</a> and his band of weary and
disappointed explorers spent that miserable and never-to-be-forgotten
winter of 1540-1541. Glowing accounts of how
Indians lived were told by the romantic Spanish chroniclers.
Still, they found only a poor simple people living by the soil
and a little hunting&mdash;but no gold.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a> was not the only province along the river. There
were others whose people had the same ways and peculiar
customs as the people at the Tiguex villages. One of these
provinces was that of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Quirex">Quirex</a>. It has been determined that
this was the district where the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> language is spoken
today by five very primitive Indian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblos</a>. They are
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_SantoDomingo">Santo Domingo</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanFelipe">San Felipe</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_SantaAna">Santa Ana</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sia">Sia</a>.
Moved by an indomitable spirit and determination, a
small band of soldiers pushed far north from Tiguex, past
the Keres-speaking villages where another province was discovered
on the upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. It was reported that two
very fine villages were to be seen. According to some students
these were in the vicinity of the present Tewa-speaking
village of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanJuan">San Juan</a>. The entire Indian population moved
out at the sight of the Spanish. They retreated into the
mountains where they said they had four very strong villages
in a rough country where it was impossible for the
Spanish to follow on horseback. Had they followed these
people they would, no doubt, have found almost inaccessible
Indian trails. Instead, they returned to Tiguex and left this
northern province in peace. Little did the Spanish realize
what extensive villages they might have seen in the rough
mountains mentioned by the Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Indians also spoke of villages on rivers flowing into the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. Could these villages have been on the banks of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioChama">Rio Chama</a> or were they on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau? They
likely were in the Pajarito region and could have been the
same villages mentioned by the Indians living near <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanJuan">San Juan</a>.
But the towns of the Pajarito remained unexplored, unplundered
and unstripped of what little they had. How fortunate
were these people to have escaped the attentions of the Spanish
with their shining armor, pointed lances and firearms.
Otherwise, these poor Indians might have found themselves
without adequate clothing and food for the approaching
winter of 1541-1542 as did the Indians at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a>. But the
passing of that second uneventful winter by disheartened
and spirit-broken Spanish soldiers ended a chapter which
was never to be forgotten by the other little <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> dwellers.
In the spring of 1542, the remnants of the Spanish were
gathered together and the return to Mexico was begun. This
must have been a day of rejoicing for the Indians at Tiguex.
They had experienced a great deal. Murder, insincerity on
the part of the Spanish, and violation of their living standards
were just a few of their trials.</p>
<p>Life went on in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a>. Slowly but surely the Indians
reorganized. Summers and winters passed and the
Indians tilled their fields of corn for two generations before
the Spanish came again. This next expedition
up the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> in 1581 was that of Captain <a class="gloss" href="#g_FranciscoSanchezChamuscado">Francisco Sanchez Chamuscado</a> with nine soldiers. This combined treasure-hunt
and missionary expedition ended in tragedy. Chamuscado
died before he returned to Mexico, and two <a class="gloss" href="#g_Padre">padres</a>,
who accompanied the little party, were murdered by the
Indians at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a>. So elated were the Indians with their
success that they drew pictures of the killings.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Dreams of conquest and fabulous empires caused the
launching of still another expedition into New Mexico in
1583. It was headed by <a class="gloss" href="#g_AntonioDeEspejo">Antonio de Espejo</a>. Espejo, too,
passed northward from the villages of the Province of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a>
which had been visited by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coronado">Coronado</a> some forty years before
and by Chamuscado in 1581. This little handful went north
to a place called <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cachiti">Cachiti</a>. This was one of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> of the
Keres-speaking group mentioned by Coronado. People who
were peaceful came from other pueblos and tried to persuade
the Spanish to go with them. They told stories of most of
the houses being three stories high. The Spanish named this
place <a class="gloss" href="#g_LosConfiados">Los Confiados</a> because the people were not disturbed.
But where was Los Confiados? It has never been determined.</p>
<p>It would be a guess to say where these other Indians
came from. It has been suggested that they might have come
from villages on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jemez">Jemez</a> River when they heard of the
arrival of the Spanish. There is still another explanation
which is also conjectural but possible. These people could
have come from villages in the mountains. Arch&aelig;ologists and
historians are unable to give us the exact extent of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a>
villages in those days although careful study and research
suggest that only seven remained extant at the time of the
Spanish Conquest. Yet, who can say that towns were not still
being occupied back in the hills? On the forested <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> tops
and in the deep water-worn <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> northwest of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cachiti">Cachiti</a>,
the Indian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> known today as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a>, are hundreds
of Indian villages now in ruins. They were occupied, hundreds
of years ago, by Indians who were probably speaking
the Keres language like the folks at Cochiti, <a class="gloss" href="#g_SantoDomingo">Santo Domingo</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_SanFelipe">San Felipe</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_SantaAna">Santa Ana</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sia">Sia</a>. These people have
told some interesting tales, legends mostly, about how all
their present villages came to be: about their wanderings,
about their Gods and about their troubles with Indians who
spoke different languages.</p>
<p>Why was it that Espejo&rsquo;s chroniclers did not leave us
more information about the town of <a class="gloss" href="#g_LosConfiados">Los Confiados</a> and its
people? Was it not important? They told us about <a class="gloss" href="#g_Zuni">Zu&ntilde;i</a> and
its Seven Cities, about the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a> villages and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a>. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coronado">Coronado</a>&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
little group, some forty years before, had visited the
Province of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hemes">Hemes</a>, now <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jemez">Jemez</a>, whose people spoke yet another
language, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Towa">Towa</a>. And history tells us that Espejo
made a two-day visit to the town of Los Confiados in 1583.
This ended his contact with the Indians at Cochiti and other
Keres-speaking villages. Could it be that Espejo&rsquo;s soldiers
looked back up into those forbidden and forested hills
against a high range of snow-covered mountains northwest
of Cochiti and decided that they had seen enough of the
Indian? Or were they told that they would have to leave
their horses behind and go afoot if they wanted to visit the
villages on streams running into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>? The
thought of wearing heavy armor might not have been too
fascinating. And if these people were from villages in the
mountains, what was their motive in attempting to lead the
Spanish there? Was it a trap? Did they have some other
motive in mind, or was their mission one of peaceful intent?
Arch&aelig;ologists now tell us that it probably has been centuries
since Keres-speaking people lived in these mountains northwest
of Cochiti.</p>
<p>If one had sufficient imaginative ability he might work
up a hypothetical case of what could possibly have taken
place during this February of 1583. To get at the basis of
our story and the things to be talked about hypothesis seems
to be our only recourse. Nothing seems exact when dealing
with early New Mexican history, but this hypothesis could
be as correct, possibly, as some of the accounts given by the
Spanish possessed of romanticism. But how close were the
explorers to Hidden Valley, the like of which they would
never again be able to see! They stayed clear of the mountains
and kept to the valleys. In all of their travels and wanderings,
the Spanish kept out of the watershed between the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Jemez">Jemez</a> Mountain Range and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> Valley. It is
today known as the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> (little bird) Plateau. The
<a class="gloss" href="#g_CanadaDeCochiti">Ca&ntilde;ada de Cochiti</a> is its southern boundary, not far from
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a>. The Rio Grande bounds it on the
east, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioChama">Rio Chama</a> on the north and the Jemez Mountains
on the west. The entire plateau is made up of deposits
of soft volcanic ash, known as tuff, and deposits of black
basalt. Geologists tell us that all this happened an inconceivably
long time ago&mdash;three million years, let us say,
in geological times known as the Pliocene and Pleistocene
periods.</p>
<p>Today the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau is a profusion of high
potreros (narrow <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a>), and deep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> cut by streams
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arroyo">arroyos</a> which carry off seasonal rains. Some of the
canyons have sheer vertical cliffs of volcanic ash, hundreds
of feet high in places, and this ash is soft enough to be carved
and hewn into various shapes and forms. The cliffs are even
soft enough for the wind to carve what appear to be statues
which stand out as exceptional works of nature. The mesa
tops are beautiful. They are covered with thick growths of
pine and juniper, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinon">pi&ntilde;on</a> and scrub oak. A profusion of flowers
dot the landscape during the summer months.</p>
<p>It was the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau that both <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coronado">Coronado</a> and
Espejo failed to plunder, not because of any lack of desire on
their part, perhaps, but because it was a forbidden land to
them and was marked by defying cliff boundaries which rose
to terrific heights. Could one say that the Spanish did not
wonder what these hills possessed when they heard about villages
on streams which ran into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>? And no
doubt, if these peaceful people, whom the Spanish followed
to <a class="gloss" href="#g_LosConfiados">Los Confiados</a>, were of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> nation&mdash;and they likely
were&mdash;then they knew every valley, stream, trail and water
hole in the Pajarito country. Espejo dispatched some of his
men to accompany these Indians. Where were they led? Did
they go up into the sandy foothills below the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jemez">Jemez</a> Mountains
and its finger-like plateaus or did they penetrate almost
inaccessible territory northwest of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a>? Or did they
march straight north up the almost inaccessible White Rock
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> of the Rio Grande? They were gone two days from
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> of Cochiti. Where did they go? Where was this
town of Los Confiados to which Espejo was invited and
about which he gave us no fact?</p>
<p>The Keres-speaking people are possessed with legends of
having been driven from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> by a race of &ldquo;dwarfs&rdquo;
at some time in the remote past. But no one is sure that this
race of &ldquo;dwarfs&rdquo; was not the Tewa-speaking people from the
northern part of the Pajarito region who descended into
Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> and drove the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> from their Hidden
Valley long before the Spanish came to America. Nor can
one be certain that Keres people were not still living in
Frijoles Canyon with the Tewas during <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coronado">Coronado</a>&rsquo;s time in
1540 or even some forty years later during Espejo&rsquo;s time.
Could one go so far as to suggest that Keres groups still remembered
how their ancestors perhaps had been driven
from their homes by &ldquo;the little strong people&rdquo; and that now
they could have a well-earned revenge by directing the attentions
of the Spanish toward the Valley of the Frijoles?</p>
<p>Had Espejo been gullible enough, and had the spirit of
adventure been strong enough; had it been summer and not
February, and had these peaceful Indians been <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> bent
on revenge against the Tewas, his soldiers might have been
led northwest up the <a class="gloss" href="#g_CanadaDeCochiti">Ca&ntilde;ada de Cochiti</a>. After an hour or so
the trail would have become so difficult that the Indian
method of travel would have been an issue. Horses would
have been left behind and the little party would have
ascended to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Potrero">potrero</a> tops on foot; over snow-covered
precipitous trails; up and down <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyon</a> walls and deep into
ancient Keres land.</p>
<p>It would have been no &ldquo;picnic&rdquo; even on foot. So
rough is the country it is even doubted that the wily
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Navaho">Navaho</a> used these trails as has been so often suggested. The
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> might have picked a more direct route; up the banks
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> to the mouth of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Capulin">Capulin</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>, over
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
high potreros, following a dim rough trail which skirted the
Rio Grande for several miles then north to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> bordering
Frijoles Canyon. And it is quite possible that the Spanish
could have gone horseback deep into Keres territory, up
Capulin Canyon to La Cueva Pintada, the Painted Cave.
The cave gets its name from the many pictographs on its
walls. Around it are the ruins of many houses built against
the cliff at the top of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> slope. Some of the Indian
legends have it that the Painted Cave was one of six towns
occupied when their ancestors were driven from the Valley
of the Frijoles.</p>
<p>Travel from the Painted Cave on into <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> land probably
would have been on foot. Up the rough <a class="gloss" href="#g_Capulin">Capulin</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>
[** Error: possible line-wrapped glossary phrase]for an hour&rsquo;s march, over snow-covered <a class="gloss" href="#g_Potrero">potrero</a> tops,
they would have passed the ruins of innumerable villages.
There they might have rested and drunk the icy water from
a running creek during this cold month of February. And
from there they made their way up to the potrero tops again,
winding and twisting, half walking and half climbing and
stopping somewhere, in a cave perhaps, to spend the night.
And then they marched on to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> of the Stone Lions,
now bleak and desolate and worn by time. The pueblo of the
Stone Lions, according to the Cochitenos, was the first village
built and occupied by the Keres-speaking people after
they were driven from the Valley of the Frijoles. The village
is known as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Yapashi">Yapashi</a> which means &ldquo;sacred enclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a half-mile away is the Stone Lions Shrine.
Carved out of native tuff are the life-size images of two
mountain lions and around them is an enclosure&mdash;a low
wall of blocks of volcanic tuff. It is said that even the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Zuni">Zu&ntilde;i</a>
Indians made pilgrimages to this shrine because they believed
this to be the entrance to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shipapolima">Shipapolima</a>, the underworld
from which their ancestors emerged. It is important
even today to the Cochitenos who visit it frequently and
leave bits of their ceremonial paraphernalia. Moving along
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
slowly, Espejo&rsquo;s little party would have trudged up the slopes
to the high <a class="gloss" href="#g_Potrero">potrero</a> tops again and then across the steep-walled
<a class="gloss" href="#g_CanyonDelAlamo">Canyon del Alamo</a>. They would have had a long
march to Frijoles over trails known only to Indians. No, this
could hardly have happened. The Spanish might never have
survived.</p>
<p>Had these Keres-led Spanish peered into the Frijoles&mdash;known
to Indians as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>&mdash;this Hidden Valley in the New
World, they would have seen the unbelievable. They would
have looked into a valley six hundred feet deep and several
hundred feet across. The opposite or north side was a sheer
perpendicular cliff of pinkish rock. There were houses terraced
high in the air, three or four stories at the base of the
cliff. There were cave openings in the cliff, over some of the
houses, which led out to open porches built of poles and
brush. Small houses of stone and mud extended up and down
the north wall of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> almost as far as the human
eye could see. People were walking around, microscopic in
size because of the distance, climbing up and down tiny ladders
to and from the tops of their houses. They were clothed
in cotton cloth, hides and furs.</p>
<p>In the center of the valley, seemingly equidistant from
both sides, was a huge circular house comprised of many
small rooms, one on top of another, with tiny ladders extending
from the ground to the roofs. Indians were going
in and out of small roof openings. Their house was a veritable
fort of primitive style. Four hundred rooms, or more,
were built in the form of a circle. The structure had an
opening or hallway through one side which led to an inner
court or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plaza">plaza</a>. A sentry was stationed inside the entrance
which was a high, thick wall built in the shape of a semi-circle
with a narrow opening. A lone Indian, or maybe two,
with bow and arrow in hand, might have been seen carrying
a deer down a narrow trail. Queer looking creatures were
these Indians with long stringy hair tied down by a band
around their foreheads. They wore <a class="gloss" href="#g_Moccasins">moccasins</a> of deer skin
on their feet. Kilts covered their thighs. They could have
been a short muscular sort of people much the same as our
modern <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> dwellers. But they were known as the
&ldquo;pygmies&rdquo; or &ldquo;the little strong people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smoke emerged from tiny openings in the roofs. Occasionally
an Indian woman would appear, black hair stringing
and her body draped with a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Manta">manta</a> of cotton cloth or
animal skins. The bark of a dog or the gobble of a turkey
which the Indians had domesticated might have broken
the silence. The waters of the little river far below could
be heard rolling over and onward toward the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>.
The occasional thud of a boulder was heard as it bumped
down stream.</p>
<p>Only one side of the valley was occupied&mdash;the north side.
The south side was covered with trees, bare now because
winter was here. The south wall of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> was not as
conducive to habitation as the north because it was worn
down at a sharp angle. There were no vertical cliffs from
which to carve out caves and no <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> slopes on which to
build little houses of stone and mud. No sun directed its
rays toward the south cliff. The snow lay there all winter
and helped cut it down at a sharp angle from top to bottom.
The north side was sunny and dry&mdash;a perfect place
for habitation.</p>
<p>There were not many people here during these last years
of the sixteenth century. Great numbers had gone: but
where, and why? A few <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cronies">cronies</a> could have been seen crouching
against stone houses at the base of the cliff, basking in
the afternoon sun. A woman or two could have been grinding
corn on flat stone slabs inside a cliff house, keeping time
to a weird monotonous chant sung by old men as they
pounded drums. Things were hanging from the ends of
roof poles protruding through the front walls of houses&mdash;perhaps
a piece of highly prized venison. House tops were
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
strewn with corncobs. A weather-beaten corn field had spent
itself.</p>
<p>This was the valley known to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> as &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>.&rdquo; It
was the place where their people had lived only a few generations
before. It was a valley over which most any group
of primitive people would fight and was a place where the
water supply was constant except in times of intense drought.
Tyuonyi is a Keres word which signifies a treaty or contract
and was so-called because of a treaty made with Tewa-speaking
people years before, marking it as the boundary
between Keres and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> territory. But who was to occupy
Tyuonyi, the Hidden Valley and the most ideal spot on all
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau? It seems that the Tewas (the little
strong people) were the ones who occupied it until the very
last. This was perhaps the reason why the Keres became
envious and that is why to this day they retain a feeling of
criticism for the Tewa-speaking people. Legend has it that
relations between the two groups in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> times were
normally unfriendly.</p>
<p>No Spanish expedition ever reached Hidden Valley, or
at least, arch&aelig;ologists have never found anything to indicate
such a visit. And I repeat, the Spanish expeditions clung
to the low valleys and kept away from the mountains. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>
then, is our subject. The Spanish never visited it and if
they ever heard of its extensive settlement by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indians
direct mention was never made of it. It was a Hidden Valley
in the New World occupied before recorded history began
in America. And today its ruins are mellowed with age.
It has yet to give up all its secrets about the cliff dweller who
hewed three hundred caves from its north cliff with stone
axes and knives, and built over twice as many small houses
at its base. They constructed five community villages on its
floor, and raised corn and beans and squash and pumpkins.
And in so doing, these <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> pueblo and cave dwellers,
and I might say historic, too, left in Hidden Valley so much
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
material evidence about the way they lived that in 1916 the
entire area, including some of the ancient <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> land to the
south, was created a National Monument. Later, a detached
section of ancient <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> territory, a few miles to the north,
was added to the area. It is known today as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a> National
Monument and is comprised of some 27,000 acres.</p>
<p>The thousands of interested visitors, who go to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a>
every year to prowl through the ruined homes located in
the Valley of the Frijoles, spend an hour or so turning the
clock back to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times when man had only bone, stone
and wood tools with which to work. They relax in Hidden
Valley&mdash;and in imagination try to reconstruct the story connected
with these ruins which hold so closely the secrets of
the past.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a></h2>
<p>Could one be so bold as to say that the Moslem Invasion
of Spain in the eighth century A.D. took place
after the first occupation of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> Valley by
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> Indians? Arch&aelig;ologists, who tell us stories based
on the remains of things they have found, broken pottery
mostly, say that Indians might have known the Rio Grande
before this time. We believe that they have occupied it continuously
since about the eleventh century A.D.</p>
<p>Drought seems to have always been one of the main controlling
factors in the migrations of Southwestern Indians.
The study of tree-rings tells us this. By matching ring patterns
formed by the annual growth of certain kinds of trees,
pines chiefly, arch&aelig;ologists are able to determine the years
in which age-old timbers were cut. Those they are interested
in are the ones used by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> Indians long years ago
for building roofs on their houses. So naturally, if an Indian
had cut a tree down with a stone axe and laid it across the
walls of his house, then the year that the tree was cut would
correspond to the approximate time his house was built and
occupied. Indians did not cut timbers until they were ready
to use them. Felling timbers with crude stone axes was somewhat
of a chore. Old beams from houses show that long
periods of drought reigned in the Southwest. It is thought
that these dry spells caused Indian families to leave
their homes and seek new lands for settlement and cultivation.</p>
<p>Such a condition seems to have existed in the entire <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanJuan">San Juan</a> area of northwestern New Mexico, northeastern Arizona
and southwestern Colorado. The greatest of the large
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
centers of Indian population, which may have numbered
hundreds or even thousands of people, were the towns of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Chaco">Chaco</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> in northwestern New Mexico and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_MesaVerde">Mesa Verde</a> cliff
dwellings in southwestern Colorado. Many of
these towns, it seems, were abandoned when the great
drought was at its height between 1276-1299, a period of
twenty-three years. And so we find shifts in population. It
is believed that some of these shifts were toward the Valley
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>.</p>
<p>Before this time small individual groups or migrant
bands took to wandering. Other Indians could have remained
even after the time of the twenty-three year drought
period, dreading to leave their homes as we would ours today.
No, there was no great exodus of population. The people
from the great towns in the west did not move out all at
one time and completely abandon their homes and desiccated
lands. They moved out in small bands, or even families. In
some way, a traveler might have reported high mountain
ranges, water and fertile lands to the east&mdash;the next best to
the places they knew as home which they and their ancestors
had occupied for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>It is possible that even in the 1000&rsquo;s A.D., small groups
pushed out over dry desert wastes, following sandy <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arroyo">arroyo</a>
beds&mdash;thought of water ever paramount. They were people
struggling again for existence. Some likely stopped along the
way and built temporary homes. They broke pottery vessels
which they had brought along. The arch&aelig;ologist found some
of the broken pieces nine hundred years later to help tell the
story. Whether these migrant bands had a goal or not is
questionable but the Valley of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> was finally
reached and scant evidence of these early people has been
found. More and more Indians moved out of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanJuan">San Juan</a>
area and drifted in a southeasterly direction. Some clung to
the valleys, others took to the mountains, but all settled in the
general locality where we find most of our colorful and picturesque
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Indian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblos</a> so well-known the world over&mdash;northern
New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is evident that by constant roaming, and penetrating
unknown and fascinating country, some of these primitive
Indians stumbled into the deep valleys and upon the high
forested <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> tops of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau, about twenty
miles west of the present city of Santa Fe. The spot on which
Santa Fe is located was then nothing but arid mesa land
and low foothills ascending to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SangreDeCristo">Sangre de Cristo</a> Range
of Mountains. Four things were paramount in the minds of
these primitive people. They were water, food, protective
shelter and clothing. These were the things the Pajarito
offered. Anyone journeying through the deep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> and
over the high mesa tops today could easily see why <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
Indians settled here.</p>
<p>For centuries the wind pounded tiny sharp particles
against cliff surfaces. It whipped up close to the ground and
hollowed out shallow caves. Very likely, these places were
not large enough for Indians to crawl in out of the weather
but the cliff composition was so soft that these natural caves
could easily be made larger. A crude stone of basalt with
a sharp edge made a perfect hand axe. Indian men hacked
out caves large enough for a little family group to enter.
Rain and cold created the necessity for heat. Drills of wood
were used to start fires in these crude cave dwellings. Fires
made them warm&mdash;suffocatingly so. There was no way
for the smoke to escape except through a wide front opening.
This lack of ventilation created a very serious problem
for the early cave dweller on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau.</p>
<p>There were other Indians who preferred to build their
homes on the high <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a> during these early times. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Adobe">Adobe</a> was
used almost exclusively to build the low walls of rooms.
Some bedded small stones into the walls before they were
dry. This helped to hold them together. Others preferred to
use larger stone, picked up at random, in building their
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
house walls. The adobe huts were undoubtedly unsatisfactory
because of their low resistance to weather. Since older
styles of pottery have been found in the ruins of these houses,
it is logical to suppose that Indians migrating onto the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>
built adobe houses first. Later they dug themselves out
homes in the cliffs which gave them greater protection from
the weather and from any invaders.</p>
<p>In this wilderness a mule deer could have fed in a little
valley or drunk from a creek. This would mean food for the
entire family or group if a crude arrow would hit its mark.
Small razor-sharp fleshers of chalcedony or basalt were used
to remove the hide from the carcass. The hide could be used
for making clothing or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Moccasins">moccasins</a>. Some of the smaller bones
might have been used as drills and awls until better ones
could be obtained. A flock of wild turkeys would have solved
this problem. Turkey bones made excellent awls. Just what
the people used for arrow points during these early times is
questionable. Maybe they brought them along from the west.
They could have used chipped chalcedony or basalt which
was readily found, and quite common in this area. An occasional
nodule of black volcanic glass, called obsidian, washed
down the creek and was found bedded in its soft sandy bottom.
Obsidian might have been more popular during later
times as the early dweller in this country may not have discovered
the ledges of black glass immediately upon his arrival.
Such could have been life on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau
eight hundred years ago.</p>
<p>More groups of people came in. Hand-hewn caves could
have dotted the soft workable walls of every <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyon</a> which
would support human life. The well-known canyon of today,
the Frijoles, was one such place. The lower part of the valley
formed a sort of a bulb for about two miles. Its sheer
cliffs on the north side rose to terrific heights. And throughout
the countless years, as boulders and dust fell from the
cliffs, a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> slope or base had formed. A little river,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
the Rito de Los Frijoles, ran for seventeen miles from its
source in the high mountains to the west and emptied into
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. This Canyon was the best in the entire
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>&mdash;the most coveted of all habitable places. The
water supply was apparently constant and the valley was
broad and open at the lower end, most suitable for agriculture.
The floor was densely covered with growths of scrub
oak, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinon">pi&ntilde;on</a> and pine. This was all that primitive groups
needed for successful living. And so we find that some of
these wandering Indians from a world a hundred miles to
the west, which was to become a thing of the past, penetrated
the Valley of the Frijoles over eight hundred years
ago. But Frijoles Canyon was not the only place occupied.
There were other canyons nearby. There was plenty of room
for all. But was there enough water in these other canyons?</p>
<p>Indian families cut their crude shelters deep enough
for occupation by several individuals. Caves were uncomfortable,
but certainly better than no shelter at all. This was
a strange sort of stone which nature had provided. It was
very poor to build with, thought the Indian. It was soft and
bulky. But years of living would eventually solve the problem.
Why worry about it! In time necessity would produce
some means of shelter more satisfactory. Later on, more people
moved into the area. These people occupied adjacent
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a> as well as Frijoles. During many years
population increased and the dwellers on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> became
settled in their locality.</p>
<p>There is no way of telling how many Indians lived in the
Valley of the Frijoles during very early times&mdash;close to water
and well protected. Indians could sit at the openings of their
cave homes above the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> slope and see for great distances
up and down the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>. And it was safe. No jealous enemy
lurking above could roll a boulder down on them. Their
cave was their protection. But caves were not adequate as
homes. Fires could not be built inside without smoking out
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
its occupants. Something better had to replace them. This
new soft rock certainly was not suitable for building walls
or at least these simple valley folk did not know how to use
it. Crude mud huts were erected at the base of the cliff at
the same time that caves were occupied as home sites. Mud
was all they could find for building walls. It took lots of
water to make mud and then it was so soft and crumbly
that the little walls cracked and fell when they dried out.</p>
<p>Soon it was found that by picking up small stones and
packing them into the soft mud as temper the walls would
stand longer. Larger rocks and less mud made better walls
and saved a lot of toil and unnecessary labor. There were
many rocks to be picked up at random. Walls were
raised high enough for the Indian to stand upright inside
the rooms. Sharp stone axes of basalt were used to fell small
trees which were laid over the tops of walls for the support
of the roofs. The blunt ends of the timbers were inserted in
holes gouged out of the cliff. Brush and grass were placed
over them; thick mud coats were smeared over the top.
Holes were cut in the roofs. Fires were built and the smoke
could escape through these holes. How much better this than
a cave! These tiny rooms were stuffy and smoky inside
but not as unpleasant as a cave room. An Indian would soon
suffocate inside a cave. During the rainy seasons the roofs
leaked and great quantities of mud were stirred up and
spread over the top and smoothed down flat. The women
could always find more when that washed off. In time weeds
and wild grasses took root in these dirt roofs.</p>
<p>But somewhere, somehow, not at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> perhaps, but
in some nearby valley or on some high <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> top at one of a
hundred colony sites, Indian neighbors found that still larger
chunks of tuff could be used for building blocks. This would
save much labor. So much mud in a wall would not be necessary.
It is possible that this use of larger building stones was
not a matter of independent origin at any one of many primitive
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
villages on the high mesas and in the deep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>. Indians, after years and years of living, simply
came into the use of larger building blocks by the trial and
error method. They served the purpose better. A dry spell
or so, when it did not rain, might have made it necessary to
transport more and more water in urns from water holes or
nearby streams. This was women&rsquo;s work and hard work too.
And more stone and less mud made stronger walls for houses
anyway. Some of the stone was so soft that it could be shaped
into blocks to fit into the walls. These blocks did not lay absolutely
flat because their surfaces were irregular. Small
stones were forced between the cracks and when the mud
mortar dried the walls were solid. This practice went on for
years and years. Indians experimented with all the materials
at their disposal. They could not send an order to the Gods
for building materials.</p>
<p>Everywhere on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> are seen the remains of
homes belonging to this period of occupation. There are hundreds
of them&mdash;small family houses, in deep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> or in a
forest on high <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> tops. Debris has filled them up and today
they look like piles of rock. Building blocks are strewn all
over the surface. Most of the blocks had been picked up at
random after they had been carved by nature. Others were
square or rectangular, showing that they had been fashioned
by Indian hands.</p>
<p>The Indians who lived in the Valley of the Frijoles communicated
with the other groups who lived in deep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a>
to the south and to the north. They visited each other and
even traded back and forth. Little colonies were formed
when one, two, three or four families lived together in a
house with several rooms. But the time was to come when
this living all over the country would stop; people would
come together to live in communities. And the little colony
sites would be abandoned forever for the arch&aelig;ologist to
discover centuries later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>A touchy subject is that of linguistics. It is a tricky one.
But students know that five different languages are spoken
among the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indians of New Mexico today. They are:
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiwa">Tiwa</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Towa">Towa</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Zunian">Zu&ntilde;ian</a>. To be on the safe
side, one should not touch too heavily upon languages
spoken by Indians, especially in a writing of this kind. But
languages and dialects do play an important part in our
story. When those early people drifted from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chaco">Chaco</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_MesaVerde">Mesa Verde</a> toward the Rio Grande, they spoke a language.
But, it is unknown. Students have ideas, but are
reluctant to advance opinions based on the ruins they excavate
or the artifacts they discover. But, two groups of
Indians speaking different languages drifted onto the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>.
People speaking different languages have never gotten
along well together even from the Tower of Babel until the
present time.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned before that Keres-speaking Indians
have a legend that long years ago a treaty or contract
was made between their ancestors and Tewa-speaking people.
It is said that certain loosely defined ranges of territory
were to belong to each of the two groups. The meeting place
or the place where the treaty was made was called &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tyuonyi&rdquo; means &ldquo;place of treaty.&rdquo; Thus the
dividing line between <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> lands became
sharply defined by what is now known as &ldquo;Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>.&rdquo;
But how long was such a treaty to last among primitive
people? All the lands to the south of Frijoles Canyon were
supposedly Keres and those to the north were Tewa. After
this treaty was made, Indians probably spread out on each
side of the Canyon like the parting of the waters of the Red
Sea. Small house sites dotted the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a> and canyons on
both sides. But still, members of both groups could possibly
have lived here together. Legend hints at this.</p>
<p>As time went on more houses sprang up at the base of
the north cliff and crude <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> were erected on the floor
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">Kivas</a> or ceremonial chambers were dug out
of the valley floor and lined with walls of rock. Indians
gathered cobble stone because they might not have known
how to cut blocks during these early times with which to lay
masonry walls. They gathered thousands of them and built
their kiva walls eight or ten feet thick. This was their attempt
to utilize the pieces of crudely shaped felsite or volcanic
ash. They laid huge timbers fifteen or more inches in
diameter across the walls of their large underground chambers.
Then smaller poles of pine were cut and laid on top
of the large vigas. Splittings were hacked from down trees.
Pine, cottonwood, juniper, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinon">pi&ntilde;on</a>&mdash;anything that would split
easily with crude stone implements&mdash;were used for the next
roof course. Then brush and grass and mud were put on top.
The roofs must have been two or more feet thick but little
did the Indians realize that the tremendous weight might
crack the big timbers after they dried out. How ingenious
were these Indians in their simple way!</p>
<p>Many a moon passed. Many houses were built. Jealousy
might have arisen between these two groups of Indians.
Who was to raise corn on this or that little patch of fertile
ground? Who should have a right to hunt deer and turkey
in the Valley of the Frijoles? How could Keres-speaking people
go to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> or how could Tewas go to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> kivas?
Trouble reigned over the entire plateau and most of it was
possibly in the Valley of the Frijoles. Was it ever decided
which group should live in Hidden Valley when it was given
the name <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>?</p>
<p>Jealousy could have arisen over pottery. When the Frijoles
area was first occupied clay deposits were discovered
in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arroyo">arroyos</a> and along river banks. Indian women began
moulding pottery with local clays. They discovered mineral
pigments. They used paints from wild plants which fired
the black designs in fast color in the vessels. The color would
never come out. But slowly and surely the women began to
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
depart from the techniques which they and their ancestors
had previously used. Out of these techniques new styles of
pottery were developed by using local materials. These
white wares with black designs became thick and coarse as
time went on and probably decreased in popularity as far
as usefulness was concerned.</p>
<p>The Keres-speaking people had kin far to the south of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau. And these people were ingenious.
Sometime in the thirteenth century, it seems, Indians living
in the Little Colorado River district of what is now eastern
Arizona and western New Mexico, were making a style of
red pottery with black designs. This pottery was apparently
very popular and spread by trade to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> Valley.
Indians in this same region eventually learned to produce a
glaze paint by using lead-manganese ore. This ware also
spread to the Rio Grande and glaze paint was used in decorating
pottery from about 1350 A.D. to the time of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Rebellion in 1680. It is thought that shortly after
its inception and perhaps by 1400 A.D. this red pottery
spread by trade to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> living here might have brought this red ware
in from their southern relatives living below the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>
Plateau. On the other hand, it is possible that they might
not have lived in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> before the time of the glaze
pottery. The most plausible explanation seems to be that
the people to the south brought the materials to their kin
in the Frijoles. These materials were then transformed into
the beautiful new hard red ware to catch the eye of the
Tewa-speaking people who likely were modeling inferior
white wares with black designs. However, there is a remote
possibility that this glaze ware was never manufactured in
Frijoles Canyon and this possibility brings up the question
as to whether or not the ware was used as a wedge to gain
entrance into <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>. The folk who were living here, either
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> or Keres, or it could have been both, were making an
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
inferior type of black-on-white pottery with local materials.
It was inferior because it was so porous. So, the Tewa-speaking
people might have readily accepted this red ware in
trade from the Keres. And it seems this trading might have
been carried on for a half-century or thereabout. No one is
sure. At this particular time there seems to have been a definite
decrease in the manufacture or trading of glaze pottery.</p>
<p>Something very drastic must have taken place. Could it
be that there was just not enough room in the beautiful
Frijoles for two groups of people who spoke different languages?
It was easily a prize spot. It was a green valley&mdash;a
perfect place to live and the water supply was constant.
It might have been the envy of Indians for many miles
around. There was not this constant water supply either to
the north or to the south. Some groups living on the high
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a> might even have depended on open basins hollowed
out of soft rock to catch the rain water. Great jealousy could
have arisen between individuals or even groups. And one
might safely guess that love affairs were broken up between
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> maidens and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> boys or vice versa. And who can
say with certainty that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> was not the earliest
known home of the Keres-speaking people in this vicinity?
Or that it was not the Tewas from the north who did the
encroaching and forced their way into the Valley of the
Frijoles and lived and traded pottery with the Keres?</p>
<p>By the time of the fifteenth century, there were many of
the Indians living to the north of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>. Little house sites
were being abandoned. People were drawing closer together
to live in larger communities. Surely, the soft volcanic ash
from the cliffs was being fashioned into building blocks with
stone axes. Some were square, some were rectangular&mdash;long
heavy four-sided blocks. It had taken Indians years and
years, possibly, to learn that this soft stone could be quarried
and then shaped. These blocks were definitely better and
single thickness coursed masonry walls were in vogue by this
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
time. This was the highest type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> architecture
on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau.</p>
<p>This was most likely the period in which the terraced
communal apartment houses were developed and erected.
There were centers of population from this time on. There
were no more small family houses. Indians built houses with
several hundred rooms, at least two, and, in some cases, three
stories high. What was the reason? Was it for defense purposes
or was it just a normal outgrowth of the discovery of
the fashioned block technique? There were several main villages
occupied by the Tewa-speaking people to the north.
They were all built in defensible positions: on a knoll, a high
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> top overlooking the entire surrounding country, or in
a valley away from the cliffs from which heavy objects could
be thrown down by enemies. These four villages were
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Potsuii">Potsui&rsquo;i</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sankawi">Sankawi</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Navawi">Navawi</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tshirege">Tshirege</a>. Potsui&rsquo;i was located
in a deep valley on a knoll. It was known as &ldquo;gap where the
water sinks.&rdquo; Sankawi was &ldquo;gap of the sharp round cactus.&rdquo;
It was built high on a mesa top in a defensible position. A
trail was worn in the soft rock by thousands of moccasined
feet going and coming from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a>. Another of their villages,
Navawi, was so-called because of a pitfall gap or game
trap. Game coming from either direction on the trail was
caught in a deep pit. Tshirege was &ldquo;House of the Bird People.&rdquo;
It was the largest pueblo on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> and had extensive
villages built at the base of the cliff. The numbers of
Indians who lived at these sites during these times cannot be
estimated though all four villages were large. It would appear
that nothing but Tewas lived here. But there also lived
their kin and kind in Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> people were living to the south of Frijoles&mdash;in
large <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> too. They had been living in this south country
for years at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Yapashi">Yapashi</a>, &ldquo;pueblo of the Stone Lions,&rdquo; and at
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Haatze">Haatze</a>, &ldquo;House of the Earth People.&rdquo; These were communal
apartment houses also but the Keres population on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
probably was not as great as that of the Tewas in
those days. Nobody but Keres lived here to the south of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>.</p>
<p>But certainly some groups held on at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>. Who can
say what happened half a millenium ago? Likely, the Tewas
in Frijoles were few. They could have been outnumbered by
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> people who might have refused to leave their Tyuonyi.
Runners could have been dispatched across trails to
the north to the big villages for help. War chiefs held council.
Warriors were called into action and could have streaked
out over age-old trails. Hideous looking creatures with flying
black hair, bow and arrow and war club in hand, went
whooping and yelling to the Tyuonyi and entered the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> at half a dozen places over the north cliff. Two groups of
Indians speaking different languages simply could not live
in the same valley, farm the same fields, live in the same
caves and drink the same water. This was the last of the
Keres. They could not hold their own because they were
outnumbered and out-fought by &ldquo;the little strong people.&rdquo;
They were driven off and the Valley of the Frijoles was
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> from then on.</p>
<p>So these beaten Indians pushed south to move in with
their kin at the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> of the Stone Lions. Whether they
ever went back to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> and attempted another stand
against &ldquo;the little strong people&rdquo; is not known. It has been
legendarily hinted that a race of &ldquo;dwarfs&rdquo; again attacked
them at the pueblo of the Stone Lions, slaughtering many
and driving off the rest. But we know of no race of &ldquo;dwarfs&rdquo;
in the Southwest during either <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> or historic times.
The poor <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a>! They were beaten at every turn. But they
knew it and moved on, occupying first one place and then
another, moving in for awhile with other kin and kind. The
farther away from Tyuonyi, the better!</p>

<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Haatze">Haatze</a>, or &ldquo;House of the Earth People&rdquo; was their next
stop but not for long. They lived here with their kind and
then moved on, down to the village of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cuapa">Cuapa</a> only to be attacked
again by &ldquo;the little strong people.&rdquo; Great numbers
were slaughtered, so the legends go, and the remainder
driven off and pursued almost to the present town of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SantoDomingo">Santo Domingo</a>. Legend has it that one group went off by themselves
and formed the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a> and Santo Domingo.
Another group, it is said, climbed up a high rock and
took refuge there from their attackers. The rock is known
as the &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Potrero">Potrero</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Viejo">Viejo</a>&rdquo; and here they built a village. One
<a class="gloss" href="#g_SanFelipe">San Felipe</a> legend tells us this: nearly all the people at
Cuapa were slain, except a woman with a parrot who hid
in a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Metate">metate</a> and a boy who hid in a store-room. These
two moved to the Tiwa-speaking village of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandia">Sandia</a> and got
a cold reception so they went east to live with the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tanos">Tanos</a>,
where the woman gave birth to five children. Things were
made so miserable for them here that they left and moved
to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> and eventually went to San Felipe. That
is why we have the pueblo of San Felipe today. These people
still know the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> as their ancestral home and it
is not an uncommon thing for them to organize a communal
hunt to the homes of their ancestors or trudge to the Shrine
of the Stone Lions and paint the noses of the life-size fetiches
or sprinkle a little sacred meal&mdash;deep in ancient <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />Building in the Great Period</h2>
<p>Time has a peculiar way of curing all ills. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> had
been driven from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> by the &ldquo;little strong people&rdquo;
and possibly did not make further attempt to re-occupy
this Valley of the Frijoles. They were contented to
stay in the broad Valley of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> where the water
supply was constant and where their enemies did not care
to go. The boundary line was set. And even the hostile Tewas
had probably experienced enough of war and trouble.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>, the Hidden Valley, might have been like an
oasis in the desert. Who can say that there was sufficient
water in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> and on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesas</a> to the north&mdash;that
water holes did not go dry and that the Tewas did not have
to depend upon waters from the heavens to make their corn
grow? And who can say that the waters of <a class="gloss" href="#g_ElRitoDeLosFrijoles">El Rito de Los Frijoles</a> dried up? One can only suppose. But judging by
climatic conditions as they are today, Frijoles Canyon was
one of the main sources of water on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>. Since water
was a controlling factor in the lives of these people, what
primitive group of Indians would not fight over the right to
live in a well-watered valley&mdash;a green and beautiful valley&mdash;where
adequate shelter was afforded by the vertical
walls of a high north cliff? Certain things hint that little time
passed before Tewa-speaking groups penetrated the Valley
of the Frijoles again and in larger numbers than before.
Slowly and surely they trickled in a few at a time. Over a
period of years the infiltration was heavy. Deep trails were
worn in the soft rock ledges by the passing over of thousands
of moccasined feet going to and from the northern villages
some ten miles distant. The steam of hatred between the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
jealous groups could have cooled off but probably never
completely. Toward the close of the fifteenth century primitive
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> farmers, it seems, had again settled in Frijoles
Canyon.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg008.jpg" alt="Building house" width="500" height="488" />
</div>
<p>They went to work in earnest this time, building houses;
not with mud walls which would wash down when it rained,
but with walls of stone, which type of construction their
predecessors had begun. Some of the caves occupied by the
earlier people could have eroded away while others could
have been re-hewn by these later occupants. Who knows?
Crumbling remains of old <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> houses might have been leveled
off at the base of the cliff and new homes built over
them. Indian men carved the heavy stones into square and
rectangular blocks with
stone axes. The stones lay
almost flat and the masons
did not have to be too
careful in their fashioning
because small pieces of
rock hammered tight in
the joints would hold the
blocks steady. These walls
were laid on footings of
smooth-worn river pebbles.
Block after block was
carved and laid into structures
seven feet high. Indian women carried water from the
little river in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Olla">ollas</a> on the tops of their heads and trudged day
after day up the steep slopes to the cliff. They gathered clay,
perhaps not from Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>, because it was hard to
find. They might have traveled miles for enough to apply a
thin coating of wash over the stone walls of their homes.</p>
<p>Indian men labored with stone axes to fell the trunks
of pines which they used in building roofs to their houses.
They gouged holes out of the soft cliff to insert the ends of
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
roof beams and sealed them in tightly with mud mortar.
Across these vigas they laid small poles. Many miles were
covered to obtain long slender canes and cat-tail stems from
the muddy low banks of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> for the next roof
layer. Then pine needles and brush supplied the next coat.
Something leafy had to hold the thick mud coats which
were smoothed flat over the top. Sometimes Indian houses
had doors in the front walls and sometimes they did not.
It all depended upon the wish of the individual builder.
Most of the houses had two-pole ladders of pine. Rungs
were lashed down tight with willows, pliable reeds or even
strings of rawhide or rope made from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Yucca">yucca</a> fiber. By
means of ladders the Indian could climb to his roof-top
and go down through a small hatchway or opening. This
gave added protection against hostile groups. In any one
of many cavate or house rooms was a fireplace. In the ceiling
above was an opening for the escape of the smoke. Cliff
dwellings were smoky places regardless of the type or style.</p>
<p>Time developed the terraced community apartment
house for the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indian in the cliff as well
as in the open flats on the floor of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>. Second stories,
it seems, came quite late in the evolution of house types at
Frijoles. Narrow mud walls of such poor quality as were
built in earlier times at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> would never have held two
stories but the new walls of fashioned rock would hold them
because they were more stable. It stands to reason that when
stone and mortar were laid into a wall, the process of drying
out transformed the wall into a unit. This process reminds me
of an expression I remember from my freshman days in college,
that: &ldquo;Pre-Cambrian rocks are homogeneous in their
heterogeneity,&rdquo; and it is certainly true that stone walls built
by our prehistoric friends of the sixteenth century could enjoy
the same comment. Floors to these houses were plastered
with fine <a class="gloss" href="#g_Adobe">adobe</a> mortar. The rough surfaces of walls were
plastered over too, from floor to roof timbers. And the cliff
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
dweller was lucky if no water got inside his house. The secret
was to keep them dry. It might not have been an uncommon
sight to have witnessed the mudding of roofs by Indian
women of sixteenth century Tyuonyi. After a good rain
they could have taken advantage of water caught in pottery
vessels which had been set outside the houses. This
would have saved the women many a weary step to water
and return.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg009.jpg" alt="Roofing a house" width="500" height="281" />
</div>
<p>One story was not sufficient so up, up, up went the houses
to two and three stories. The cliff formed the back walls of
the rooms&mdash;then Mr. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">Prehistoric</a> Indian had only three walls
to lay instead of four. Walls of stone, ten and twelve inches
thick, would hold the weight of one or two additional stories
and especially when they leaned against the steady cliff.
But additional rooms meant more poles, more cane, brush
and mud. When second and third story rooms were added
the smoke from fires in rooms below escaped through a front
opening. There was no way for the smoke to escape through
the upper rooms and the cliff dweller was smart enough not
to cut a hole in the floor and let the smoke into his house
above. And, too, second and third story rooms likely were
much safer than first story rooms. Ladders could be pulled
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
up to the roofs. Who knows that these Tewas were not thinking
of revengeful <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> people to the south?</p>
<p>In some cases caves were hewn and used independently of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> houses to the front but certainly it was impossible
to stay inside while large fires were burning. The poor cliff
dweller would have suffocated. Many attempts were made
to ventilate caves by boring smoke holes above the doorways.
But it was impossible to ventilate a cave successfully. Not
much of a draft was created. Indians attempted to ventilate
their cave homes by cutting as many as three holes through
the soft cliff and then plastering the holes on the inside to
facilitate the passage of the smoke. They met with little
success.</p>
<p>Fires were kindled inside and when smoke filled the
room the Indian either had to go outside or into his <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a>
house. I once had an experience with fires in caves. Undoubtedly,
the Indian of long ago experienced the same as I.
When a fire was kindled the smoke circled around and filled
the chamber. The vents did not work. Smoke hovered down
to the height of the door and went out at that point leaving
a definite line of demarkation around the cave wall. The
Indian plastered the wall underneath this smoke line so that
his house would not be so filthy and so that he could crouch
down and lean his shoulders against it without getting soot
all over his back. I have seen cave walls exhibiting as many
as thirteen thin plaster coats. Never let it be said that caves
were popular places in which to live while large fires were
burning inside. Perhaps our <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> friend knew that if
he built a fire inside his cave the walls would warm up.
Then hours later, after most of the smoke had gone out, he
could return and be quite comfortable without suffocating.
And he, no doubt, would have rolled down a deer skin or
matting of corn shucks over the opening to keep out the cold
during the winter months.</p>
<p>The majority of the caves at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> were connected
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
with the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> houses to the front. Caves entered from second-story
rooms were very popular and likely were used,
for the most part, as ante-chambers and not as independent
dwellings. They were excellent for storage purposes and
if the Indian wanted to live he had to hold food over from
one season to the next. Covering a period of a little more
than a hundred years, let us say, the Indians of Frijoles
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> cut over three hundred cave rooms in the north
cliff. Some were, used independently of the houses to the
front but most of them were not. Caves were hewn before
houses were built, and likely, a great number of them were
cut after the talus houses were erected against the cliff. They
built just as many houses as caves, if not more. Houses extended
as far as four rows of rooms out from the cliff and
they were terraced up as high as three stories. On top of
them were open porches which we call &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Ramada">ramadas</a>&rdquo; today.
They were mere shelters with four corner poles and a few
cross pieces of juniper or pine with brush and leaves over
the top. What delight some old <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cronies">cronies</a> might have had
basking in the sun during some hot summer afternoon!</p>
<p>This was the valley of the cliff dweller, the Ancient <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a>
more than likely, who built houses and cut caves for almost
two miles up and down the north cliff of Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>.
Here he could see for great distances&mdash;he could look up and
he could look down. He could hear the water rippling in the
Rito below and he could live in true Indian fashion. But
these villages were not built in a day or a year. It took many
years. Although there are the ruins of enough houses and
caves along the north wall to have housed two thousand
primitive Indians, no more than a few hundred ever lived
here at one time. There simply wasn&rsquo;t land enough to farm,
or game enough to supply food for a greater number. It
would seem that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> never had a static occupation but
an ever moving one.</p>
<p>The cliff dwellers at Frijoles, like their kin to the north,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
knew that the only safe method of living was in communities.
So they erected what is known today as the &ldquo;Long House.&rdquo;
One section of the north cliff was almost vertical and its base
sloped gently down to the waters of the little river. This
must have been the concentration of the cliff homes. Rooms
were built side by side for over seven hundred feet. There
were few cave rooms here to crawl back into and out of the
weather. These people must have learned by experience how
uncomfortable caves were, because they stuck to houses with
stone walls and roofs of poles and brush and grass and mud.
And they built these homes solid against the cliff and even
carved recesses in the cliff so that the ends of the building
stones would fit perfectly. Then the walls would not slip. The
Long House was not very far from water&mdash;fifty yards. This
was just a step for the women.</p>
<p>Some of the dwellers carved and painted pictures on
the back walls of their houses or even in the caves which
had barely enough room for three or four people to occupy.
Call it writing if you like. It likely was &ldquo;doodling.&rdquo; They
had no written language. They were forced to record what
they thought and what they believed or had seen on the
walls of their houses or in the designs of their pottery. Birds
were the most common design. A mountain sheep was occasionally
drawn, or a squirrel, or a rabbit; perhaps a bear
or a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Katsina">katsina</a>&mdash;a supernatural being. They might have tried
to depict their ancestors emerging from the darkness and
climbing up a high pole from the underworld of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sipapu">Sipapu</a>.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Awanyu">awanyu</a> or &ldquo;plumed serpent&rdquo; was quite common. It
was the guardian spirit of springs. In one cave there was
a drawing of a horse and certainly this was not an ancient
drawing for the Spanish brought the horse to New Mexico.
Some wandering <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> could have seen the Spanish on
horseback&mdash;on creatures which Indians thought devoured
people. It might have been that other Tewa-speaking people
from around the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> of San Juan, far to the north,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
described a horse by pictograph, when they hurried into
the mountain homes of their kin after seeing the Spanish
in 1540. Or it might have been drawn by some visitor after
the evacuation of the Indians. It could even have been
someone&rsquo;s joke.</p>
<p>About a quarter-mile from the cliff dwellings, and where
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> becomes narrow, is a deep natural cave. It is
eighty feet across and its opening faces the valley one hundred
fifty feet above the waters of the Rito. One <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
group lived here for a time. They were certainly secluded.
Hand holds were gouged from the soft cliffs with sharp
pointed rocks and here in this, now called &ldquo;Ceremonial
Cave,&rdquo; Indians built seventeen first-story rooms and several
second-story rooms around the back. They excavated a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a>
or ceremonial chamber to the front of the cave. Think of
the task these Indians had when they carted water and
poles and sticks and perhaps stones up the side of the cliff.
Tons of rock were required to build these houses and the
ceremonial chamber. This little group built their kiva twelve
feet in diameter. It was a circular affair dug to a depth of
nine feet and lined with a wall of stone which was plastered
on the inside. The floor was of a special kind. It was hard,
black and shiny. It had been polished with a smooth stone
like the ones the Indian women use today to polish their
black pottery. Only this floor was made of blood&mdash;animal
blood. The Indians carefully saved the blood from animals
which they killed and then mixed it with fine silt and soot
from the fire and smeared it over their kiva floor in thin
layers. When the blood coagulated the plaster hardened
and then it was polished by rubbing a smooth stone over it
in backward and forward motion. This must have been an
important room to have had such an elaborately made floor.
But kivas in prehistoric times may have been more important
than they are today.</p>
<p>In the floor were six small holes in a straight line. While
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the plaster was still wet small pieces of oak or some other
tough pliable wood was bent in loops and the ends of each
piece were pushed down into the soft mud plaster. Then
these holes, or round depressions were made around the
loops leaving them exposed. These were directly below a
horizontal pole suspended from the ceiling. This was a
loom. By an arrangement of long straight sticks these ingenious
Indians devised a method of weaving. Since it is
thought that in years gone by women and children were not
allowed in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> to break up the complacency of a man&rsquo;s
ceremony, we might suppose that some old man sat here
and ran a shuttle through warp cords of cotton strung
vertically from roof poles to floor loops. Here he carried on
weaving of a ceremonial nature with cotton or animal hair
while the smoke from a ceremonial fire in the fireplace
circled around making the kiva a very unpleasant place to be
despite an elaborate system of ventilation.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;high-up&rdquo; cave dwellers had their houses built
like the ones at <a class="gloss" href="#g_MesaVerde">Mesa Verde</a>, completely sheltered by the
overhanging cave roof. To the side of the dwellings, situated
near the back wall of the cave, was a turkey pen of little
cleanliness. When I discovered this pen hundreds of years
later, the floor was covered with human feces, turkey and
rodent droppings. They had all lived here in times anterior
to the coming of the Spaniards&mdash;Indians, turkeys and
rodents. The Indian hauled his water and food from
the valley below. He secluded himself from the bulk of the
Indian population at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>. The question will always be,
why? Of course, there was a small <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> on the other side
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> on a little knoll across the river but this might
have been built, occupied and abandoned before Indians
ever occupied the big cave as a place of residence.</p>
<p>And then, there were Indians who preferred to live on
the floor of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a>&mdash;terraced community
apartment houses. Several hundred yards below the concentration
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
of the cliff dwellings and in the lower end of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> they built such an apartment house. Little is known
about it because it has never been excavated. Broken pieces
of pottery, the most important tool of the arch&aelig;ologist, are
found strewn over its ruins today. Its walls are down now
and its rooms are almost completely filled in with debris.
This particular group of Indians preferred to have their
dwelling close to water and they erected it with stone and
mud mortar. This is all that is known of this isolated settlement.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that the most popular dwelling places
in Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> were the dwellings at the Long House,
so well protected by the sheer vertical cliff wall. These could
have been over-crowded. Indians might have cared little
about living in other sections of the cliff. It might have
been that some of the cliff dwellers had experienced terrible
slides when hundreds of tons of loose rock and boulders came
tumbling down on their little houses, crushing them like
pasteboard boxes and burying the occupants alive. All the
man-power in the northern part of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau could
never have rescued their kin who might have been caught in
these cave homes. Those rocks had rolled from the top to
stay and there they remain today. One wonders what stories
those buried caves hold&mdash;if, by chance, the skeletons of the
occupants are still there. Indians perhaps have died scratching
at the boulders which covered the entrances to their
caves or tearing their hair and clutching their throats as
they suffocated and fell extended on the hard plaster floors
in their rooms. Those caves have never been opened.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the valley floor could have been
more popular as a dwelling place than sections of the cliff
more susceptible to slides than the Long House. A part of
the main population built and lived in a large terraced community
apartment house known as &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a>
where the women scraped the bottoms of the pottery vessels
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
clean.&rdquo; This is now the famous ruin known the world over.
It has been featured in the <i>National Geographic Magazine</i>
and many other publications.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> never existed during the very early occupation
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>. Its initial wall stones were not laid until the
beginning of the Great Period. Any Indian family might
have erected a few rooms near the little river&mdash;close to
water. Then another family came along and built a few
more rooms. A son took on a wife and the entire family
helped to build his house, since house-building was a community
proposition. Indian men went to the slopes where
boulders had rolled down and broke them with heavy stones
and fashioned the pieces into uneven building blocks. This
was no small job. Walls were laid in mud mixed by the
small brown hands of Indian women. Poles were cut and
laid across the walls, then splittings and cane and brush
were laid over the tops and sealed with thick coats of mud.
Thick coats of crude plaster were spread over the inside of
walls and over floors. These Indians had little clay, none for
walls anyway, without hauling it in on their backs, so, they
poured hot ashes into the mud to make it stick. Hot ashes
formed a sort of lime. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coronado">Coronado</a>, in 1540, found the Indians
at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a> making a mortar and plaster in this manner.
Slabs of basalt were brought in and set edgewise in the
rooms as fireplaces. This was the home of the newlyweds&mdash;built
right next to the groom&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s house. The young
bride could have come from the Long House to live at
Puwige, the community house, with her husband&rsquo;s family.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The place on which <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> was erected was so situated
that the Indians had to make walls with sharp turns to follow
the contour of the land. This must have been a popular
place to live for as time went on more and more rooms were
added. Indians evidently preferred this to the vulnerable
cliffs. It was not all planned and executed at one time. Some
second-story rooms were added and then porches of poles
and brush were built. Additions of rooms continued until
Puwige was shaped in the form of a crescent with the open
part facing the little river which was only a few feet away.
Indians lived here for untold years. Something happened.
I know not what. It seems that they closed the gap by building
three rows of rooms. It was no more a crescent but a
circle of rooms built around a large <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plaza">plaza</a> or inner court.
Rooms were built in rows, seven deep on the east side of
the circle and three on the west side. There were about three
hundred rooms on the ground floor and many second and
third-story rooms&mdash;four hundred in all, more or less. The
place was turned into a veritable fort. These people were
cunning. They cut seven rooms out through the east side
and formed a narrow passageway through which everyone
had to pass in order to enter his home. They went from the
outside of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> through this narrow passage, dodging
obstructions, until they reached the huge inner court. And
then they ascended to their respective dwellings by means
of small ladders, pulling them to their roof-tops during times
of danger. Leave it to the Tewas, &ldquo;the little strong people,&rdquo;
to find ways and means of protecting themselves from lurking
danger.</p>
<p>I was once told a story by some <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> Indians
about this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> hallway. Guarding the hallway was a
half-circle barricade of stone and mud. It was several feet
thick and both ends joined the walls of the main building.
Through this circular wall was a small opening. The wall
must have stood six or eight feet high to have been effective.
Now the Tewas contend that at one time, long ago, a sentry
was stationed day and night inside the circle. When Puwige
was attacked the alarm was given and a huge boulder was
rolled in front of the opening. This was to slow down the
attackers. If they were fortunate enough to get by the boulder
then it was intended that they stumble over a slab of
basalt set edgewise in the passageway. It must have stood a
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
foot or more in the air. If the attackers got by the stone
without losing balance, then they encountered numerous
wooden posts bedded upright in the dirt floor of the long
narrow passage. How confusing and prohibitive! Entrance
to Puwige was almost impossible unless &ldquo;the little strong
people&rdquo; desired it. For the villager, an Indian woman with
a water jar on her head, moving along slowly, entrance was
easy, but for the enemy&mdash;no. Warriors stood on housetops,
high in the air, and shot sharp-pointed arrows at enemies.
They threw rocks and pottery vessels. They fought with
clubs&mdash;anything they could get their hands on. Puwige was
not easy to penetrate.</p>
<p>Was this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> occupied by any particular group or
were the people of the cliff houses allowed to scramble down
and hurry to the inside for protection? Was it a fort for the
entire community or just for the people who lived here?
The cliff homes were being lived in at the same time as
Puwige and might have been more effective as defense units.
There was only one side to protect in the cliff homes&mdash;the
front. And who were the attackers: <a class="gloss" href="#g_Navaho">Navaho</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> or other
groups? Legend has it that the Navaho plundered the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a>
for years and years and history tells us so. They stole the
hard-earned stores of food from the pueblos and ran off with
the women and children whom they made slaves. But it isn&rsquo;t
likely that the Navaho, on foot during the days of Puwige,
cared much about penetrating the mountain homes. It
would have been a chore to carry the loot back with them.
The Navajo likely did not relish the idea of coming over
the high range of mountains from the west for a few pots
of beans and corn. Would it not be more likely that the so-called
&ldquo;little strong people&rdquo; might have feared attacks during
the night by the Keres to the south who had been driven
from their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> homes? <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> was &ldquo;the oasis of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>&rdquo; and the Tewas did not intend to be driven from
their fertile valley. Some lurking band could have crept
over the south cliff when all was quiet&mdash;while Tewas were
resting peacefully below. And the attackers were quiet too,
with their moccasined feet, like the mountain lion which
creeps upon a fawn. A falling rock or the crackling of a
dead branch would be a dead give-away. This was not to
happen to &ldquo;the little strong people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1540 the Spanish explorers passed the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> province
and moved northward, it would appear, near the present site
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanJuan">San Juan</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a>. The entire Indian population fled to
the mountains, as you will recall, where they said they had
four very strong villages. It is entirely possible that some of
these people from the north pushed deep into the mountain
country and on to the Valley of the Frijoles where the Spanish
could not go on horseback. It was a Hidden Valley. If
this had been true, if these northern people had moved into
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> with their kith and kin and had told about how the
Spanish stormed pueblos and shot cannon at other Indians
and readily conquered the inhabitants, &ldquo;the little strong
people&rdquo; might have had incentive to fortify their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a>
against the undesirable attentions of the conquerors. Or it
might have been some visitor from the Valley of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> who told about depredations at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tiguex">Tiguex</a>. But would
a Keres warn a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a>? We must not overlook the fact that
it would have been possible for friendly relations to have
existed between the rival groups of people at the time of the
Spanish Conquest. They could have lived
close together and traded pottery and other
articles back and forth. One might go so far
as to say that they could have lived at
Tyuonyi together a few years prior to
its abandonment. But taking
all these things into consideration
it was likely the Keres
whom the Tewas fortified
themselves against, and from
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
whom they had probably experienced hostile visits. So they
fortified their Puwige and drew up their ladders to the roof-tops
in defiance. And the people in the cliffs also drew up
their ladders.</p>
<p>Within the inner court of this big community house
were three <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a>. These deep underground ceremonial chambers
lined with rock walls were built adjacent to the rooms on
the north side. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> was large. It was more than two hundred
seventy-five feet across and the tiers of rooms formed a
wide band around the outside of the circular court. Why the
Indians erected three kivas so close together is uncertain
unless it was to have more room in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plaza">plaza</a>. It is possible
that the kivas were erected first, outside of the village, and
as the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> grew the three little ceremonial chambers
were entirely enclosed within it. But why three kivas inside
Puwige? Indians had their reasons. These three ceremonial
chambers were small. They were not more than twelve or
fifteen feet in diameter. The hard plaster floors were seven
or eight feet below the surface of the ground. Their roofs
were of poles laid across the stone walls with brush and
grass and mud for a covering. Small combination hatchways
and smoke vents were cut in the roofs and ladders
were put down to the floors as a means of getting in and
out. These chambers were likely society kivas of which
there were several in every Indian village. Or we might
compare them with club rooms in our own society. They
were places where the elders met in council, or where they
came to spend an hour or so, perhaps a week, visiting with
their spiritual fathers. Kivas were places where policy was
discussed and decided upon&mdash;or a kiva might have been
a place where a group of hunters gathered before going
on a hunt to pray that their hunt would be successful. We
will never know what went on in the secret chambers at
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>, or as a matter of fact, in any other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
kiva.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>And speaking of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> or ceremonial chambers, some
groups preferred to have theirs in the cliffs, hewn out like
the smoky cave rooms but generally larger. And the kivas,
like the cave rooms, were plastered half-way up the walls
whenever they became smoked. This happened quite often
if fires were kept burning.</p>
<p>The greatest period of occupation of Hidden Valley
must have begun sometime during the fifteenth century. It
was to last about a hundred years. With the beginning of
this Great Period, the period in which <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> and all of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> houses were most likely built and occupied, there
certainly must have been some social or ceremonial organization
similar to that in the modern <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a>. There were
likely two moieties. The dual system where every person in
the village belonged to one of two <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a>&mdash;either Turquoise
or Squash, or, Winter or Summer respectively. Presumably
a baby born in the winter belonged to the Turquoise kiva. If
it was a patrilineal society then the individual might have
belonged to the same kiva as his father. Who knows but
that it was a matter of personal choice? Each kiva, Turquoise
or Squash, had a ruler or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cacique">cacique</a> whose word was absolute.
He was the father of the village to whom villagers looked for
guidance and his appointment was for life. The moieties
were under the spiritual guidance of the two town chiefs
who were responsible for the welfare of the people. An important
office was that of cacique. He had been chosen because
of his thorough knowledge of chants, sacred rituals,
ceremonial procedure and prayers. No one doubted the word
of the cacique. And all Indians owed duties to their respective
kivas. Although the groups, Turquoise and Squash,
were in opposition they also depended upon one another for
the common good of the pueblo.</p>
<p>If the dual system was in vogue at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>, there must
have been two <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> to support it. A peculiar thing, it seems,
took place here. At least one tribal kiva was built and
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
was in use before the Great Period of occupation came
along. It was a large structure forty-two feet in diameter.
Sixty Indians could have crouched down around the inside
against the wall. Indian men, years before, excavated a large
concave depression in the side of a hill a hundred yards or
so down the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a>. Days and days were required
to bring in thousands of cobble stones. They labored
untiringly. They brought them from the river and they
brought chunks from the cliff. Around this deep concave
depression which they had laboriously scooped out of the
earth with broken pieces of pottery, sticks, flat stones and
whatever else they had to work with, Indian men laid stone
after stone of this volcanic tuff in crude mortar. They laid a
wall ten feet thick. It required thousands of the unworked
stones to line this deep pit. It was a circular affair and was
their way of creating a semi-subterranean chamber when
they did not know how to lay single thickness masonry walls
with fashioned blocks.</p>
<p>No <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a>, that I know of, has an
entrance through its wall such as this which was found at
Frijoles. They all were entered through the roof. Such things
as wall entrances are customary in kivas in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanJuan">San Juan</a> area
but not in the Rio Grande Valley. And these early people
dug five pits in the floor of their kiva and lined them with
cobble stones. They must have had some use for them of
which we know nothing. Pits of this type are something else
not seen in prehistoric Rio Grande kivas. They are found in
the kivas at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chaco">Chaco</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> though, and it is possible that
they could have been vestiges of that early culture.</p>
<p>This particular ceremonial chamber had apparently
fallen into disuse for a time. But during the Great Period
of occupation, when &ldquo;the little strong people&rdquo; presumably
occupied the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>, it was rebuilt. There was little use
in going to work and building an entirely new <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a> when one
was already here and could be rebuilt. The old roofing had
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
fallen to the inside and there were hundreds of pounds of
debris in the kiva chamber. All this was cleaned out.
Building a kiva was a community enterprise. Men again
began cutting and fashioning rectangular blocks from large
chunks fallen from the cliff. As each block was fashioned it
was laid into a single thickness coursed masonry wall around
the inside of the thick wall of cobble stone which belonged
to the earlier occupation. The Indian was smart. He laid
this circular wall sloping outward toward the top so that the
pressure from the heavy roof would be diverted downward
when it was laid over the walls. When the wall was finished
it was nine feet high from the floor of the kiva to the ceiling.
And then to keep it from falling down, the Indians
dug underneath the footing stones, and objects modeled of
clay which looked like doughnuts were laid in the holes.
When we discovered these doughnut-shaped affairs I was
mystified until an old Indian from <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> told me
they were put there purposely to hold the wall up, in a spiritual
way of course.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg014.jpg" alt="Felling trees" width="500" height="638" />
</div>
<p>What a large structure this
was! It was almost as large as the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chaco">Chaco</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> where the
ancestors of these Indians probably
lived several hundred years
before. There was no kiva this
large in the entire <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>
Valley. Huge timbers forty-five
feet long were required to span
its diameter and timbers that
large were difficult to
carry. But with crude
stone axes and obsidian
knives these kiva builders
penetrated the forest
to cut girders for
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
their ceremonial chamber. In the year 1513 A.D. or thereabout,
they cut three trees with trunks fifteen inches or more
in diameter. It took hours, days perhaps. They hacked and
they pounded with their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Neolithic">Neolithic</a> implements of toil until
all three trees had been felled. I would hate to estimate
the time required to fell these timbers but time meant nothing
to the Indian. Then there was the job of removing all
the branches, needles and bark.</p>
<p>Preparing a girder in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> times was a great
task. Green timber is much heavier than seasoned wood. And
so these timbers weighing a ton or more were dragged out of
the forest to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a> with stout ropes made of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Yucca">yucca</a> fiber.
Sheer strength was all these people had. There were no carts
with wheels on them to bear the brunt of the load. Heavy
objects had to either be dragged or carried. After much
sweat and toil the ends of the huge poles were rolled over
into position in shallow trenches worked out for this purpose
on both sides of the kiva. These three timbers formed the
under structure of the roof. When they were placed exactly
like the Indian wanted them, pointed rocks were driven into
the ground around the ends and the open spaces were packed
with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Adobe">adobe</a> so that these huge round logs would not roll.
They placed much smaller timbers of pine across the huge
vigas. These were not so difficult to cut and they were laid
about three feet apart. From down-timbers of pine, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinon">pi&ntilde;on</a>,
cottonwood or any other type of fallen trees they hacked and
ripped long narrow sections for the next roof course. The
splittings were transported in bundles to the kiva and one
by one they were laid close together over the small pine
poles. Great quantities of thin willow branches, cane or cat-tail
stems were used for the next course. Pine needles, brush,
yucca leaves and whatever leafy material they could gather
was placed on the top. They needed this brush and leafy
material because it was to hold the thick heavy mud coats
which were spread over the top. Indian women carried urn
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
after urn of water on their heads from the Rito and stamped
and mixed this mud. The only chore left was to throw dirt
over the top.</p>
<p>When the ceremonial chamber was finished it looked
like a huge, low mound&mdash;almost level with the ground.
The Indians did not forget the square opening in the top for
the exit of the smoke. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">Kivas</a> were stuffy places inside. And
as in all kivas there was a ventilator. This had been built
during the earlier period of occupation and reused during
the Great Period. It was a mere tunnel which looked like
a fireplace and it suddenly turned upward like a fireplace
chimney. The mouth of the chimney was level with the
ground so that the draft would be downward and would go
into the kiva and lift the smoke from the firebox to the ceiling
and eventually out the square opening. The Indian of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> did understand something about ventilating a kiva.
He was smart enough to know that if the top of the ventilator
was built very far above ground level it would work like
a fireplace. Then all the smoke would be drawn to the floor
of the kiva and sucked out through the low tunnel. And in
this case he could not have remained inside. But he never
found out how to ventilate his cave room in the cliff. How
unfortunate!</p>
<p>Directly across the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a> in the west side was the entrance
which had also been put here years before. It was merely a
tunnel with a roof of small juniper branches. The outside
end was open and was just large enough for the ends of a
two-pole ladder to rest. Indians usually go into their kivas
through the roofs, but not here. They climbed down the
ladder, stooped, and with knees in a flexed position scurried
through the tunnel to the inside.</p>
<p>The five pits in the floor, which have been mentioned
before, were apparently no longer needed for they were
filled in with dirt and stones tightly packed. A thin layer of
dirt was thrown over the entire floor surface. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">Kiva</a> floors are
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
generally plastered over and during this period of occupation
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> women, more than likely, were the ones
who smeared four fine coats of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Adobe">adobe</a> over the floor and
smoothed it out with their hands.</p>
<p>I have neglected to mention one of the most important
things of all&mdash;the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sipapu">Sipapu</a> or ceremonial entrance from the
underworld. It was the place of ceremonial emergence into
this earthly life. Arch&aelig;ologists generally find a small hole in
the floor of almost every <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a>. But here at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> a special
kind of Sipapu was made. A piece of soft volcanic ash was
formed into a rectangular block and buried edgewise in the
floor. A small hole shaped like an icecream cone was drilled
in the top as the spirit entrance. The Indians have a legend
about this. It is symbolic of the entrance to the land of
&ldquo;Earth Old Women&rdquo; and of the place where the human
race originated. Long ago they climbed up a Douglas Spruce
Tree and came into this world through a lake called Sipapu.
And when they die the spirits go to Sipapu and on to the
underworld. It is said that this lake is located in the sand
hills north of Alamosa, Colorado. How important the kiva
was to the Indians of Tyuonyi! Sipapu represented the place
of creation and to them it was important in no small way.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cacique">cacique</a> of each one of the big tribal kivas, both Squash
and Turquoise, was a direct representative of the Earth
Mother or &ldquo;Earth Old Woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the dweller at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> had forgotten something. He
did not realize how tremendously heavy the roof of his big
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a> was. He did not know that the small pine timbers, the
splittings, brush, grass, mud and dirt would cause the big
pine vigas to bend and sag and crack in the middle. It is a
question whether or not the roof fell in during some important
ceremony. The situation had to be remedied at any rate.
Pine poles, nine or ten inches in diameter were cut so they
would support the weight of the roof. Six holes were dug in
the kiva floor, two under each of the big vigas. Flat rocks
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
were put in the bottoms of the holes and the ends of the six
timbers were inserted and swung into place under the big
girders, and driven with heavy rocks into an upright position.
The big vigas might have sagged a little but the roof
never fell after this time. Flat stones were driven tight around
the bottoms of the support posts and the holes in which they
rested were packed solid with mud and rocks to keep the
timbers from slipping. And this was how the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
Indian at Tyuonyi built his ceremonial chambers in which
women were not allowed unless requested by the men. There
might have been more than one roof put on this kiva. The
first one could have been laid during the latter part of the
fifteenth century. It could have fallen and then been rebuilt.
Arch&aelig;ologists do know that the last time this large kiva was
roofed over was during the early part of the sixteenth century.
We found one of the large charred ends of a big roof
timber and it had been cut in 1513 A.D. So it was about this
time that the last kiva roof was laid. Just how long it was in
use is a question. It was surely used until the end of the occupation
of Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> sometime near the close of the
sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The Indians of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> during the Great Period had
developed the dwellings in the north cliff extensively to the
number of some three hundred caves. There might have
been twice as many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> houses to the front, some one story
and others two and three stories high. The cliff population
centered around the Long House while other groups built
houses in different locations at the base of the north cliff.
And still other groups built the big community apartment
house of about four hundred rooms to a height of possibly
three stories and called it &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> where the
Indian women scraped the bottoms of the pottery vessels
clean.&rdquo; And they built it in the form of a fort with a narrow
hallway through the east side as the only means of entrance.
And here they fortified themselves during times of attack
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
by other Indians like themselves who might have been
jealous of the watered Valley of the Frijoles. Another group
preferred to remove themselves down the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> a quarter-mile
and they erected a circular pueblo, a miniature of
Puwige, seemingly. Still another group preferred to be more
isolated and so they chose a deep cave one hundred fifty feet
above the Canyon floor in which to build their house and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a>.</p>
<p>One would think, looking at the ruined home sites, that
thousands of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> Indians dwelt at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> but that
was never the case. Although the dwellings were extensive
they were not all occupied at any one time. Small groups
moved in. Others moved out. They could have taken turns
living in Hidden Valley and then returned to the northern
villages of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Potsuii">Potsui&rsquo;i</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sankawi">Sankawi</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Navawi">Navawi</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tshirege">Tshirege</a>, where
their kin and kind lived. Tyuonyi might have been a place
for summer occupation during the growing season. When
planting time came little groups trickled in from the large
northern community villages and remained for a while. One
cannot be sure of what went on in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>. It was a
suitable place for continued occupation with the possibility
of an influx of population during the summer months. One
can only speculate. Scientific investigation reveals nothing
in this regard. The legends are scant now&mdash;the old men who
remembered them are just about gone. So one is left with
little about how Indians lived on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau during
prehistoric times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Living in the Great Period</h2>
<p>It would have been an utter impossibility for thousands
of Indians to have lived off the corn, beans, squash
and pumpkins raised in the Valley of the Frijoles. But the
several hundred who did live here had to eat and in order
to eat they had to work. The Indians of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> were farmers
and were largely dependent upon the products of the
soil. Only a small part of their sustenance was from animals
and birds. Of course, there was game of all kinds. There
were deer, perhaps elk and mountain sheep, bears, turkeys,
rabbits, and fish in the creek. But even though this was wild
country, several hundred Indians living in the locality would
soon have depleted the stock with their communal hunts.
In the fall of the year there were grouse in the high mountains
and ducks along the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. But imagine how difficult
it would have been to kill a grouse or a duck with a
crude bow and arrow. The deer might have been the prize
of the Indians at Frijoles. They ate the meat and used the
hides for <a class="gloss" href="#g_Buckskin">buckskin</a>. They knew the rabbit and the mouse
and knew that the woodrat gathered the edible <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinon">pi&ntilde;on</a> nuts
to store away in its hiding place. The robber, since there was
a large crop of the nuts only once every few years! They ate
the squirrel. Skunk skins were probably used for ceremonial
purposes. The raccoon, however scarce, likely formed part
of the diet of the cliff dweller. And although Indians knew
the birds of the forest, they probably did not digest the meat
of hawks very well. As a matter of fact, most birds were too
fast for the ever-seeking valley dweller with his crude
weapons.</p>
<p>Few Indian ruins are excavated in which the remains of
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
corn are not found. The
ancient inhabitants raised
corn&mdash;much corn. It was
the most important item
in their diet. The fields
in the lower end of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> were fertile. The
valley was a paradise for
primitive people. During
corn planting time tiny kernels were sown in the rich
fertile ground which had been broken with digging sticks
and crude hoes. There were likely no large continuous
fields in this valley but only small patches where individuals
might have had separate fields. Adolph <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a>
suggested that the ancient people irrigated in the Valley
of the Frijoles. How lucky they were if this were true.
It is more likely that they depended on the waters from the
heavens. When it was extremely dry the Indian women
transported water from the little river in urns on the tops of
their heads. And so heavy were the jars filled with water
that they were obliged to use soft pot-rests of grass. Corn
was planted in April and was likely sown under a waxing
moon so that it would grow with the moon. The Tewas believed
that when corn was sown
under a waning moon, the seeds
quit growing. With careful nursing
and watering from April until
September, the pigmy ears
grew. In the early fall
the corn was gathered
by the men.</p>

</div>
<p>A day at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>
during &ldquo;corn gathering
month&rdquo; about 1537
A.D. was an interesting
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
one. The large <a class="gloss" href="#g_Plaza">plaza</a> inside <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> was swept clean, if customs
of yesteryear parallel those of today, and the corn was
brought therein. Corn, they believed, had life like people and
would be glad to be brought in and housed and protected.
It was placed in piles and everybody from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> helped
with the husking&mdash;men, women and children. And when
they finished they might have gone to the cliffs to help their
relatives with their husking. As fast as the ears were husked
they were thrown on the flat mud roofs of the houses to dry.
These Indians did not use all the corn at once. The old
women thought of crop failures the next year and so they
saved a double amount of the life-giving grains to plant the
year after. After all the husking was done, the pueblo was
swept clean with brooms made of grass bound with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Yucca">yucca</a>
fiber or corn husks. This was in preparation for a festival&mdash;a
dance perhaps, to observe the gathering-in of the crop.
Strange customs these Indians had! While corn was standing
in the fields it was the property of the men. As soon as
it was gathered, husked and stored, it belonged to the
women who were the caretakers, even though they took
little part in pueblo life at Frijoles which was predominantly
a masculine society.</p>
<p>Not all the four hundred rooms at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> were used for
dwellings. Perhaps no more than a hundred Indians lived
here. The smaller rooms around the inside of the circle, more
than likely, were used for storage purposes. If this were so, it
was here that great stores of corn were kept&mdash;inside the
circle, safe from plunderers and robbers. How important
this corn was! It might have been offered to the Gods as a
request for various favors and Indian women might have
taken corn along when they went to look for pottery clay,
for clay was a scarce item here. And some of the people
might have worn little bags of corn around their necks.
Even in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> times a corn cake would have tasted
good. Green corn was pounded into a pulp, patted into a
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
cake and then baked on a hearth of black stone over a little
fireplace. And Indian women could have greased the little
cakes with the fat of a deer to make them tasty. When
the corn was all dry old women knelt before their angled
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Metate">metates</a> set in bins and with a hand-piece or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mano">mano</a> of black
basalt they ground. Their
fingernails were worn oblique
on the ends from constant
rubbing in rhythmic time
with a corn-grinding chant
sung by the men as they beat
a drum or two. And they
ground on three or four
metates. First, they broke the
corn, then by the time it was passed on and ground on each
of the metates, it was transformed into fine corn flour. And
lastly, it was stored away or perhaps packed over the mountains
to other villages. Some of it might have been traded
for buffalo hides by traders who penetrated the buffalo
region to the east, far out of the realm of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> and adjacent mountains.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg016.jpg" alt="Grinding corn meal" width="500" height="361" />
</div>
<p>There were many uses for corn. Bundles of grass were
bound together at the tops with twisted corn shucks and
used as brooms. And even cigarettes could have been made
by wrapping corn husks around the dry leaves of some tobacco
plant. Only the old men smoked. Smoking could have
taken place in one of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> at a time when a delegation
arrived from another <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a>. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> and Tewas might have
held council at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>, about Tyuonyi itself, and passed
around from each to other a fire-stick with a glowing end
from the fireplace as a lighter. Mats and door-flaps were
made of plaited corn husks and it would not have been an
uncommon sight to find these coverings over the openings of
some of the houses at the base of the cliff. Corn was certainly
an important item.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Arch&aelig;ologists have recovered beans also&mdash;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinto">pinto</a> beans.
It was a type known to the Indians before the Spaniards
ever thought about the New World. During some of our
excavation work I found that the people who had lived in
the Ceremonial Cave, far above the concentration of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>&rsquo;s population, knew about beans as well as the rest of
the dwellers. Beans were one of the staple foods. The people
at <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> today know them as &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewatu">tewatu</a>.&rdquo; It is possible
that the same name was given beans at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
Frijoles.</p>
<p>There were many uses for gourds also. Half-sections were
scraped clean of their pulp and used as dippers and ladles.
Whole gourds were used as rattles in ceremonial dances.
Broken pieces could have been used to scrape and smooth
wet pottery before it was fired.</p>
<p>Almost everywhere were products of the earth. And
they were used to their fullest extent. These people even
knew about cotton. Whether it was ever raised in Hidden
Valley is questionable. Pieces of the simple over-and-under
weave cloth have been found in the ruins. The growing season
in the mountains might have been too short. It might be
that these Indians traded with their neighbors to the south
for their necessary supply of cotton. Cotton was woven into
ceremonial paraphernalia and also into garments. Men wore
cotton breech clouts while women wore large mantas of
cotton cloth. This cloth was suspended from one shoulder
downward covering one side of the breast, wrapped once
around the waist and then taken up the back of the shoulder
and tied in a knot. A very important item was cotton.</p>
<p>All of the wild plants were utilized and especially when
cultivated crops gave out. There were many in the valley
growing wild along the fertile banks of the Rio de Los Frijoles.
There were gooseberries, currants, the berries of sumac,
onions, milkweed, strawberries, blazing star, horsemint,
dandelions and prickly pears from the round leaf cactus.
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
Even the ball cactus might have been eaten. And surely
many of these were stored for later use. Little did these primitive
dwellers know what might befall them. Raids by hostile
bands often destroyed their fields. Fire might have been
set to the roofs of their homes. A period of drought could
have been one of their worries even here in the Valley of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>.</p>
<p>Mother Earth gave the Indian everything. She lavishly
produced juniper and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pinon">pi&ntilde;on</a> wood for fires, choke-cherry,
juniper and oak for stout bows. And there was hard wood
for the foreshafts of arrows and cane for the hind shafts to
which turkey feathers were fastened as guides. She produced
sticks for clubbing rabbits to death. There was rabbit brush
for yellow paint. The leaves of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Yucca">yucca</a>, when pounded up and
dried, could be twisted into stout rope and cord. Extremely
tiny cords were used in making fishnets. Strips of yucca were
used in making baskets and also for making brushes used in
painting and decorating pottery. Stout strips of the tough
leaf were used for tying. And the Indian even knew how to
extract the medicinal properties from plants. The Valley of
the Frijoles produced for the primitive dweller most of the
things he had to have for successful living.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg017.jpg" alt="Making pottery" width="500" height="525" />
</div>
<p>While Indian men, it seems, laid the walls of the houses
and repaired them, and cut the heavy roof timbers&mdash;while
they planted corn and hunted, the women were not idle.
The art of pottery making has long been
the pride of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> women. They did the
whole job from beginning to end. They
searched the river and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arroyo">arroyo</a> banks for
clay and they carried it to their homes
where it was kneaded and rolled
out into long rod-like strands. All
pottery was coiled. They began at
the very bottom and brought the
long strands of tempered clay
round and round in the general shape they desired. And
then they patted and smoothed the vessel out with wood or
gourd scrapers. When it was dry, they applied a slipping or
wash coat over the outside. When this was done the vessel
was decorated with various crude designs. It was then put
into an open fire smothered with wood, corncobs, pine
needles and grasses so that the heat would be retained. This
was their method of firing. When a vessel was removed from
the fire and the ashes wiped off, a dirty white background
with black designs appeared. There were several different
types of this ware made at Frijoles. Today we call this pottery

<p>The most common type known to the arch&aelig;ologist
today is Biscuit ware. It is so-called because it is exceptionally
thick and porous. These Indians made flat squatty
bowls, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Olla">ollas</a>&mdash;the common wide-necked jars. These were
inferior types and not nearly as good pottery as was made by
other Indian women at other villages. It was tempered with
soft volcanic ash. Tiny particles were worked into the soft
clay to keep it from cracking and resulted in a soft powdery
ware which was easily broken. It is possible that these
women were not very well satisfied with their pottery made
from local materials. The same thing was true at all the villages
on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>. When water was put in the jars and
bowls they became soft. It certainly was not a satisfactory
type of ware. And the Indian women might have been very
much ashamed. Pottery making was their work, their art
and their pride. But the materials in this country simply did
not make good hard pottery despite the ability of any individual
potter.</p>
<p>However, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> women made good hard pottery.
They had the clays and the tempers with which to
work. They were still making the ware with the slick red
finish and glaze designs on the outside which was developed
in the Little Colorado district of western New Mexico and
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
eastern Arizona. They were even making the polychromes
or multi-colored wares by this time. Trading this pottery
might have been the solution to the problem of the Tewas
even after the Keres-speaking people had been driven from
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>. New generations of Keres might have had a
different way of looking at things. Although the red glaze
ware had become coarse and heavy by this time, it surpassed
the soft Biscuit wares made by these valley women. They
were probably glad to accept it in trade. From about 1400
A.D. all through to the abandonment of Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>,
the glaze wares were present. The glazes did not stop here
but are found at <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> villages far to the north. These people,
too, had been making the same soft ware as did the
dwellers in the Frijoles. So it does appear that some sort of
a relationship could have existed between Keres and Tewa-speaking
groups of people even during these late times.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg019.jpg" alt="Pueblo beside a cliff" width="500" height="625" />
</div>
<p>The main occupation, it seems, lasted well up toward
the close of the sixteenth century. Several generations
of Indians had lived here either in cliff
homes or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> on the floor of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>.
Any night might have witnessed hundreds of
tiny smokes emerging
from smoke holes in
roofs. The glow from
tiny fires inside the cliff
rooms lighted the doorways
in the front walls.
A sentry, perhaps, with
bow and sharp-pointed
arrow was posted at
the entrance to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a>,
the big community
house, or on some
nearby high point
where he could comb
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
the landscape with sharp eyes and would warn the pueblo
dwellers that warriors were approaching. A summer day
would suggest men basking in the sun or attempting to net
out fish from the little river below. Women had jars on their
heads. Others were gathering berries and greens. A hunter
was greeted as he strolled forth triumphantly with wild
game for a meal or two. A sudden summer cloudburst
of rain or hail&mdash;delightful and refreshing and good for the
corn too, interrupted
the sameness of things.
The tiny drops sent an
Indian mother with
baby on her back scampering
for shelter. Children
were running and
laughing but ever alert.
These are only a few of
the incidents of six
hundred years of living,
primitive and insecure
living, which went on in the Valley of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg019a.jpg" alt="Welcome rain" width="500" height="413" />
</div>
<p>Toward the close of the century the waters from the
heavens stopped. Corn fields dried up and the waters of the
little river were no more. The curse of the Southwest had
hit again. The lands became drier and drier as the days
passed. Cliff homes were like ovens as the hot sun beat down
upon them. The same thing happened here as happened to
their ancestors in the west centuries before. The Tewas, living
in the big villages to the north, were experiencing the
same thing. There was no water in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a>. Water holes
had gone dry. And there was no water from the heavens to
be caught in great rock cisterns. Small groups began to
move. Others hung on. Could it be that Hidden Valley
was to go the way of all the rest? It was true. Moving was
a necessity now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg020.jpg" alt="Abandoning the pueblo" width="500" height="365" />
</div>
<p>It is not known how many Indians lived at this
place during those last days of drought and it is possible
that those who might have remained did not wish to be left
in Hidden Valley close to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> land to the south. So, slowly
but surely, group after group trickled out of the Valley of
the Frijoles, leaving their homes to the mercy of the elements.
Within the course of a very short time the entire
population had evacuated. They crossed deep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> and
high <a class="gloss" href="#g_Potrero">potrero</a> tops&mdash;dry now&mdash;and helped to cut just a little
deeper the very same old trails in the soft rock, which had
been worn down by thousands of moccasined feet for countless
generations. Before they left it seems that they must have
destroyed almost everything they possessed. Fire was set to
the roof of their large <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a>. This was the end of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>.
Hidden Valley had witnessed its last great occupation. It had
been occupied by Indians for six centuries&mdash;Indians who had
lived, raised corn and beans and squash and pumpkins, and
who had fought and died. The occupation of Frijoles possibly
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
was tottering at the time the Espejo expedition came
up the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> Valley in February of the year 1583. A
few stragglers could have still been here&mdash;who knows? But
certainly by the close of the century Tyuonyi was a thing of
the past. The roofs to the houses were falling in&mdash;timbers
were rotting and cracking under the tremendous weight of
poles and brush and mud. Walls fell. It was a deserted town
with a background as colorful as any other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> in the
Southwest. Hidden Valley was still here but its actors were
no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />Cliff Dwellers Again</h2>
<p>By the close of the sixteenth century, it seems, all of the
great towns&mdash;the terraced community apartment houses
on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>&mdash;had been abandoned. Life in the hills
and mountains had grown unbearable because of a shortage
of water. These people, I have no doubt, disliked leaving
their mountain homes. The mountains were more conducive
to successful living than the hot sandy banks of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. But this made no difference now&mdash;moving was a
necessity. Groups pushed off the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> tops and down the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> into the Valley of the Rio Grande. Soon little settlements
sprang up. This move certainly must have been a
step down for the cliff and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> dwellers. They had lived
for centuries on the wooded mesa tops near high mountains
and had drunk spring water. Now they had only the muddy
waters of the Rio Grande. They established the village of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Perage">Perage</a> on the west bank of the river about a mile west of
their present pueblo of Powhoge or San Ildefonso. Other
groups could have gone to other Tewa-speaking villages.
Just when the pueblo of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> was established is not
certain but it was long, long ago.</p>
<p>Tewas could live in peace now and raise corn, beans,
squash and pumpkins, for here the muddy waters of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> were ever flowing. But it was not for the Tewas to
say, or think, that they could live in peace. The next Spanish
expedition taught them this. The expedition headed by <a class="gloss" href="#g_DonJuanDeOnate">Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate</a> was the colonizing expedition into New Mexico.
In 1598, soldiers, colonists, carts and baggage streamed
up the Valley of the Rio Grande and took possession of New
Mexico in the name of His Majesty, the King of Spain. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
time the occupation was in earnest. Four hundred or more
settlers and soldiers marched up the valley, the settlers with
everything they possessed in the way of tools and personal effects.
Thousands of domestic animals were brought in. The
Spanish meant to stay this time.</p>
<p>In the north <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> country, beyond <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a>, was
the Province of Yunqueyunque which is thought to have
been located near the present <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanJuan">San Juan</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a>. It was here
that the first capital city of New Mexico was established by
the Spanish on July 11, 1598. It was called <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanGabriel">San Gabriel</a>.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the Tewa-speaking people on
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau were abandoning their homes in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a>
and on <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> tops and moving to the banks of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> where they built the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> of San Ildefonso. These
Indians built the pueblo with rows of houses two and three
stories high and built their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> on top of the ground instead
of below the ground as they had done in their former
homes.</p>
<p>After O&ntilde;ate had been removed from office as Governor
of New Mexico, the Viceroy appointed <a class="gloss" href="#g_DonPedroDePeralta">Don Pedro de Peralta</a>
and the capital was moved from <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanGabriel">San Gabriel</a> to Santa Fe
in 1610. Governors changed. Each made new laws. Indians
were used as slaves. They produced goods for the Spanish.
Children went to school and all went to church. They took
on Christianity&mdash;yes, but they retained their old beliefs and
old forms of worship. Roman Catholic Missionaries built
churches in many of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> which the
Indians paid for. Some were flogged for not wanting to go
to church, but this new form of religion was forced upon
them. Hours were long and hard and taxes imposed by the
Spanish were exorbitant. This kept up for seven decades.</p>
<p>Rebellion was on the way. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Acoma">Acoma</a>, the Sky City, was the
first village to rebel. This was quelled. Then the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jemez">Jemez</a>, then
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanFelipe">San Felipe</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a>, our Keres-speaking
friends, rebelled. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Alameda">Alameda</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Isleta">Isleta</a> were next. But these
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
uprisings were not put down. It all ended up in the bloody
and terrible Pueblo Rebellion of 1680. Spaniards were murdered
right and left all over New Mexico. The Tewas of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> were in sympathy with the Rebellion. They
had suffered too, and so they marched with their allies regardless
of creed, clan or language spoken, to Santa Fe, the
capital city. The remaining little handful of Spanish refugees
had gathered in the Palace of the Governors as a last resort.
One white cross and one red cross were sent to the Spanish
Governor <a class="gloss" href="#g_Otermin">Otermin</a> by the Indians. White meant peace.
Red meant war. The Governor chose war. But the cause was
hopeless now. The Spanish were outnumbered and their food
and water supply had been cut off. Surrender was the only
alternative, so, on August 21, the Spanish left the Palace and
back-tracked down the Valley of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. The Indian
now had his land back. He could live in peace along
the banks of the river and raise his crops, so he thought. No
more toil and no more taxes. But this Utopia was not to be
realized.</p>
<p>Even though the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Navaho">Navaho</a> had taken an active part in the
uprisings, he began to cause trouble as soon as the Spanish
were out of New Mexico. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> people had not counted
on this. The Navaho had taken everything from the Spaniard
that he could use against him, including the horse. As
soon as the weakened Pueblo people thought they had rid
themselves of trouble and war and killing, the wild Navaho
took advantage of the situation. Terror reigned for a decade
or more. The Navaho swooped down upon the pueblos at
night, plundering and killing. Putting up with the Spanish
might have been easier to take than this. But all was to
change again. <a class="gloss" href="#g_DonDiegoDeVargas">Don Diego de Vargas</a> marched up the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> with another colonizing expedition, soldiers and
missionaries. Pueblo after pueblo was reconquered and Santa Fe was re-entered in 1693. The Pueblo people were not too
hard to bring to submission this time. The Spanish would
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
help their warriors to drive off their enemies. The pueblos
had had about all they could take from the Navaho.</p>
<p>Then there were the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> villages to be dealt with up
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> between Santa Fe and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> of San Juan. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> Tewa fled to a high black rock
known as &ldquo;Black <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a>.&rdquo; It had been used by them for years
as a place of defense. From its top the country can be seen
for miles around. It was here that they held out against the
Spanish soldiers from January until September of 1694.
They finally surrendered after several unsuccessful assaults
at their rock and a siege which lasted for five days. Black
Mesa figures considerably in the mythology of the Tewas.
They say that during this seven-months period while their
people were besieged on the high mesa top, brave men descended
through the precipitous gap during the night to the
Rio Grande below to get water for their marooned people.
Black Mesa is sometimes known as &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_MesitaHuerfano">Mesita Huerfano</a>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Orphan Mesa.&rdquo; It is said that a giant lived here at one time
and caught children from the pueblo which he and his wife
and daughter ate. He was at last killed by the Tewa War
Gods. Legend has it that the giant&rsquo;s heart is still on the mesa
top in the form of a white rock.</p>
<p>We have almost forgotten the Keres-speaking people to
the south who were also having trouble. During the Rebellion,
the Cochitenos abandoned their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> and moved
back up the <a class="gloss" href="#g_CanadaDeCochiti">Ca&ntilde;ada de Cochiti</a> to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kotyiti">Kotyiti</a>. This was, according
to their legends, the last site they occupied after
being driven from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> and before establishing the
present <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a> on the banks of the Rio Grande. Kotyiti was
built on top of a high <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> known to the Spanish as &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Potrero">Potrero</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Viejo">Viejo</a>.&rdquo; It is a mesa about two miles long and several hundred
feet high. It was a natural fortress for the Indians, and it
was to this fortress that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> moved back and built
their homes shortly after the beginning of the Rebellion.
This fortress was known as &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_HanatCochiti">Hanat Cochiti</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cochiti
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Above.&rdquo; With the coming of Diego de Vargas in 1693, the
Indians fled from the pueblo on the river to their mesa and
put up a stiff battle, but in vain. After their reconquest,
broken and tired of trouble, they moved back to Cochiti in
1694 where they have been ever since.</p>
<p>But what trouble the Tewas of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> did have!
There suddenly came another outburst of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> rebellion
in June of 1696 and the people of San Ildefonso burned
their beautiful church which had been built for them by the
Spanish with Indian labor, sweat, blood and taxes. Two
priests were caught in the burning building as well as several
other Spaniards. There they all perished. The San Ildefonso
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> have a legend and a belief that they should
always move to the south and never to the north. But someone
wanted the pueblo moved to the north. And so there was
a contest between good people and sorcerers, and the sorcerers
won by witchcraft. The pueblo was moved to the
north. The San Ildefonso people believe that this is the
reason why they had pestilence and famines, and why their
people decreased in numbers. Such trouble they had!</p>
<p>Could it be that during these trying and troublesome
years at the close of the seventeenth century, some of these
heart-sick and war-weary Indians decided that life back on
the high forested <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">mesa</a> tops or in deep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyons</a> to the south
where their ancestors had lived, just a century before, would
be better than this? Could they tear themselves away from
their brethren at night and sneak south, back into the hills
and down into deep canyons protected by high vertical cliffs,
even into Hidden Valley? Spanish soldiers on horseback
could not find them here. They could not follow the old
Indian trails. Perhaps those known as the &ldquo;good people&rdquo;
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> were so opposed to moving their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a>
a little to the north that they refused to have any part in this
plan and preferred moving far to the south.</p>
<p>To assume that such a move took place would not be
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
folly even if we had no supporting evidence. Families could
have removed themselves to the hills of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a>. Here
Hidden Valley offered them protection. It was deep in the
south country and water had returned to the creek. The
drought period was over and there would be water from the
heavens again. The old abandoned dwellings in Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>
were in ruins. Roof timbers had rotted and walls had
fallen. These were the homes of their ancestors. But with
very little work these homes could be made livable again.
And so, in a remote section in the lower end of Frijoles, the
Indians again went to work in a group of rooms high above
the floor of the Canyon. They were a quarter-mile from the
ruins of the Long House and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> which were in open
sight.</p>
<p>Like true cliff dwellers in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> times they rebuilt
old homes into new ones. Rooms were cleaned out. The old
roof structures were removed from the inside. Loose building
stones were removed from the broken-down walls. And the
cave rooms above were also cleaned out. Indian men again
cut pine timbers for roof poles with crude stone axes. They
rebuilt walls and laid the poles over the tops. Indian women
mixed mud&mdash;good hard <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> mud. They brought in clay
from nearby <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arroyo">arroyos</a> or from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a> and raised their
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> houses two stories high. Some of the caves, after a hundred
years, had eroded beyond use. Doorways and fronts
had fallen. Indians gathered fallen building blocks strewn
along the base of the cliff which had been fashioned by their
ancestors. They built artificial fronts to the caves and plastered
them over with mud. Fine clay mortar was smeared
over the floor and rough surfaced walls. Doorways were built
in the front walls of houses. Ladders were built. A corn
patch was planted. Game likely was plentiful now. Black
volcanic glass was chipped into sharp arrow points. A deer
or two were brought in triumphantly from a hunt. And they
created new homes for themselves and brought life back to
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
Hidden Valley while their kin and kind struggled on and on
with Spaniard and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Navaho">Navaho</a>.</p>
<p>Safe at last, they lived again. Corn was harvested in the
fall of the year and shucked and stored. Indian women
ground corn on old worn <a class="gloss" href="#g_Metate">metates</a> left there a century before
and the men again chanted away in time with the beat of
a drum which echoed between steep <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyon</a> walls. Baskets
were made of juniper and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Yucca">yucca</a>. Blankets of fur and feathers
were sewn together. Stout cord was twisted from the fibers of
yucca. Indian women made brooms of grass tied with corn
husks and yucca fiber to sweep their sooty rooms, while
brown-skinned babies rolled in the dust. Gourds were
scraped and made into utility vessels and Indian women
again carried water in urns on the tops of their heads from
the little creek far below.</p>
<p>It undoubtedly took some readjustment to live in the
cliffs again after a century of acculturational contact with
the Spanish. Just how many Indians or how large a group
returned to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> homes is not known. But by this
time we see that the Indian had acquired a few things from
the Spanish either by trade or thievery. This little group
brought with them pieces of metal and wooden objects of
possible foreign origin, objects brought in by the Spanish to
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>. One such object, which we found, was a
two-pronged pick of viburnum, elaborately carved on top
with a sharp steel blade. It was not much longer than a hair-pin
and reminded one of such. Its use is still puzzling. And
the Indians brought woolen cloth which was definitely post-Spanish.
The Spaniards had brought the sheep to New Mexico.
The weave of the cloth was such that it could not be
mistaken. Could it have been from a Spanish garment or
was it Indian-made? It is even possible that these people
were wearing woven garments of wool when they reoccupied
the Frijoles.</p>
<p>The little community was a poor one. There is no doubt
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
about it. The Indian made fire in the same old way with fire
drills. A blunt round piece of wood was turned so fast in the
groove of a flat piece of wood that fire was produced. These
people used cultivated tobacco at this time&mdash;a variety never
before discovered in the Southwest of this early age. During
a moment of temptation, the writer rolled a cigarette from
part of this Indian mix which he found buried in a small red
bowl. He smoked it without any ill effects. It looked like
tobacco, smelled like tobacco and tasted like tobacco. Discarded
fragments of pipes were found which had bowls of
hard wood burned through. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Moccasins">Moccasins</a> of deer skin sewn
together with sinew were found. Could they have been made
in Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> or were they brought into the valley by
these Indians? Whichever was the case, they were worn out.
One pair was half-soled&mdash;not like our half-soles today, but
on the inside. A new piece of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Buckskin">buckskin</a> had been cut and
fitted and sewn to the inside of one of the worn-out moccasins
which had been discarded.</p>
<p>The chirp of a turkey hen or the gobble of a gobbler
created a dead silence in any primitive household. The calls
echoed and could be heard for a half-mile. Even today, we
stop and listen and follow the call just for a glimpse of the
wild turkey. It is exciting. A tenseness of nerve and muscle
envelops a person. An Indian father crept noiselessly down
the steep slope to the valley far below&mdash;stopped, listened&mdash;not
a sound but the whining of the wind through the high
tops of pines or the caw of a raven flying high above, or the
rolling waters of the little river. Following again and picking
each step, bow and arrow in hand, ready to draw, he
stopped. The turkeys were coming closer and behind a rock
he hid or laid close to the little river out of sight. They
were almost upon him, feeding peacefully on grasshoppers
and bugs. A well directed arrow would mean meat for the
whole family. That the Indian used only the feathers of the
turkey is an idea of the past. The broken food bones are
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
found in the ruins of ancient homes. Besides using the meat
of the turkey for food, the Indian used the feathers for ceremonial
purposes and strips of turkey feather spines made
excellent wrappings for making arrow guides.</p>

<p>Such was life in Hidden Valley after the conquest of
New Mexico by the Spanish. Living in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> at this
time was apparently a necessity. It could again have been
our Tewa-speaking friends who raised corn, beans, squash
and pumpkins in the beautiful and colorful Valley of the
Frijoles and who watched the sun, day after day, pass down
behind the cliff to the land of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sipapu">Sipapu</a>. But time again had
a way of making things right, though not just as the Indian
desired it. After the close of the seventeenth century, it
seems, Frijoles was abandoned again. The Indians left their
cliff homes and moved back to the Valley of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>.
There was little trouble with the Spanish from then on and
the Indian wars were over and all were subdued and the
ancient homes in Frijoles continued to crumble and walls
continued to fall. A little
time was all that was
necessary to completely
cover the abandoned
dwellings. Howling winds
beat sharp particles of dirt
against crumbling walls
and eventually filled them
in and covered them. Deep
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kivas</a> were no more. Small
stones, boulders and dust
fell from the cliffs covering
up <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a> houses. Huge
slides covered many homes
and the wind and rain beat against the vulnerable cliff
walls and eroded many of the caves almost beyond identification.
Indian occupation was ended now but Hidden
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
Valley still remained. The Rito de Los Frijoles continued
to cut its course deeper and deeper through the soft
volcanic ash as it had done through six hundred years of
Indian living. Struggle had ended over the Tyuonyi. It was
deserted to the ravages of time. To the south the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> were
settled now, and to the north the Tewas. They were content;
and Hidden Valley was left alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />The Spanish Era</h2>
<p>The early part of the eighteenth century saw the Spanish
interested in more than <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indians. There was
the actual colonization of New Mexico and the war with
France which drew their attention. New Mexican land was
divided into tracts or land grants. The Spanish had combed
it all. They knew about the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyon</a> today known as the
&ldquo;Frijoles,&rdquo; the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a> Indians. The tract lay
just south of the bounds of what is known as the &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_RamonVigilGrant">Ramon Vigil Grant</a>.&rdquo; It was in litigation much of the time. The land
was cleared, broken and put under cultivation during the
latter part of the eighteenth century. The valley floor was
cleared and no doubt some of the homes occupied by Indians
years before were obliterated. This valley was given the
name of <a class="gloss" href="#g_ElRitoDeLosFrijoles">El Rito de Los Frijoles</a> sometime prior to the
year 1780. For years, people have said that the Canyon
derived its name from the fact that Indians raised beans
here in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> times. True, prehistoric Indians did
grow beans at Frijoles but the derivation of its name
probably had no connection with any Indian occupation.</p>
<p>With the coming of a new century, Spanish people were
accused of living in the caves of the Rito like barbarians.
This picturesque Hidden Valley was a rendezvous for cattle
thieves and persons whose characters could be questioned.
It was a den for robbers who greatly troubled the people
around the country, so, in 1811 the Spanish Governor ordered
all its inhabitants to move out. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> must have
been occupied more or less continuously throughout the nineteenth
century by farming groups of Spanish-Americans.
And they were troubled by Indian raids from time to time
until the latter part of the century.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The walls of ancient caves today are pocked with nail
holes. Sheepherders might have camped for a while and
left initials and dates picked in the soft stone. Cow bones
strewn at the base of the cliff, now dry and white and brittle
with age, are the only sad memorials of what went on. And
many are the hidden legends. Every little <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">canyon</a> in the locality
has a name. Something happened to give them their
names. One, Water Canyon, was formerly known as &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Diesmo">Diesmo</a>&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Ten-Percent Canyon,&rdquo; because a priest collected
ten percent of the lambs from sheep owners as a tithe for the
church and herded his flocks in this valley. Everything has a
meaning in this colorful land. There still exists today a circular
platform of blocks of tuff on the floor of Frijoles Canyon.
Local farmers claim that it belonged to them and their
fathers before them. It was used as a threshing floor. I have
heard that it was a dance pavilion or platform and was advised
that if I brought over some of the Indian women from
<a class="gloss" href="#g_SanIldefonso">San Ildefonso</a> and asked them to do what they were supposed
to do, they would begin dancing the ring dance. The
stories are many but will the truth ever be known? Time is
slipping by.</p>
<p>Within quite recent years the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Navaho">Navaho</a> has used the old
trails, just passing through, going to some <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> to trade
perhaps. Even <a class="gloss" href="#g_Zuni">Zu&ntilde;i</a> Indians have passed through the Valley
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>&mdash;resting a few minutes and drinking of the
waters of <a class="gloss" href="#g_ElRitoDeLosFrijoles">El Rito de Los Frijoles</a> as they might have done
in years past when they were supposed to have visited the
Stone Lions to the south. And Indians from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a> have
returned to their Tyuonyi during summer months to raise
a little corn. These people religiously return to the homes of
their ancestors. Even today, certain of the old <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> men
from northern pueblos trudge south into timbered mountainous
country and erect shrines near their ancestral homes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
They carve miniature pueblos three and four stories high
out of volcanic boulders of soft ash. They build altars and
burn ceremonial fires. They dig holes in the soft ground,
line them with little rocks and cover the holes with green
branches from the juniper tree. Many times I have seen
evidences of these ceremonies along dry <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arroyo">arroyo</a> banks on the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pajarito">Pajarito</a> Plateau.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />Present Times</h2>
<p>In 1880, <span class="sc">Adolph F. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a></span>, famous Swiss ethnologist,
archivist and historian, entered the Valley of the Frijoles.</p>
<p>At the time, he was connected with the Arch&aelig;ological
Institute of America and had been sent to New Mexico to
work among the Indians who today live in mud-walled
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> up and down the banks of the Rio Grande. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a>
spent a great many days at <a class="gloss" href="#g_SantoDomingo">Santo Domingo</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cochiti">Cochiti</a>
seeking out legends and myths regarding the people&rsquo;s past
and present and it was from the Cochitenos that Bandelier
learned of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>. Bandelier&rsquo;s descriptions of the surrounding
country are thoroughly detailed. He must have possessed
a very keen mind to have so well described geographical
features in such brief association. He entered Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>,
the Tyuonyi of the Cochiti Indians, on October 23 of
that year.</p>
<p>It has been said that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a> lived in the caves of the
Rito de Los Frijoles, and, according to stories passed around
by hearsay, he could have lived in a dozen different caves.
It would be nice, and perhaps poetic, to say that the famous
student hung his coat or his hat on such and such a nail,
when wire nails such as are found in these caves probably
did not exist during Bandelier&rsquo;s visits to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a>. The
general opinion among people who remember Bandelier is
that he did spend some time in one particular cave high
above the Canyon floor. It was a double-chambered cave
overlooking <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a> and the entire broad and open lower
end of the Canyon. The view was perfect. It might have
been here that Bandelier organized some of his notes which
resulted in the never-to-be-forgotten ethno-historic novel,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
<i>The Delight Makers</i>. People have said that Adolph Bandelier
lived for years at Frijoles, but this is not true. His investigation
of practically the entire Southwest took only five
years to complete. So we might limit his stay to days, but
those days counted. It was Bandelier&rsquo;s intent to portray history
and arch&aelig;ology in the guise of fiction and here he laid
the basis for his famous novel which brought fifteenth-century
dwellers of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a> to life again.</p>
<p>The works of Charles F. Lummis will never be forgotten&mdash;<i>The
Land of Poco Tiempo</i>; <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesa">Mesa</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">Pueblo</a></i>.
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a> and Lummis were very good friends and although
their opinions and ideas conflicted at times, this friendship
was never broken. Many times has Lummis visited Frijoles
and many times has he stayed in the old Indian cave rooms,
even in quite recent times, when other accommodations were
available.</p>
<p>In 1907, Judge A. J. Abbot settled in the Valley of the
Frijoles. He built a ranch house out of the ancient building
stones of volcanic ash. The stones came from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a>, the
big community house. Cut and fashioned in the sixteenth
century or thereabout, by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> Indians, they were
used again. The place was known as &ldquo;Ten Elder Ranch,&rdquo;
because of the box-elder trees growing nearby. The ranch
changed hands three times and was subsequently known as
&ldquo;Frijoles <a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> Ranch&rdquo; until the old buildings were torn
down and replaced by modern unique <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblo</a> style buildings
designed by government engineers and known as &ldquo;Frijoles
Canyon Lodge.&rdquo; It would be an utter impossibility to name
all of the famous personages who have visited Frijoles or
were entertained at the old ranch place. The Commoners
and the Nobility, people from the four corners of the globe
came, some of them leaving a little remembrance or token
of their appreciation&mdash;a poem about the Frijoles perhaps,
a card, a thank-you letter, an invitation&mdash;they are too numerous
to mention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>In 1916, the area was created a National Monument and
named in honor of Adolph Francis Alphonse <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a>. It
has been known as such ever since. But to the &ldquo;old timers&rdquo;
it is still the &ldquo;Rito&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_ElRitoDeLosFrijoles">El Rito de Los Frijoles</a>.&rdquo; They remember
the times they either walked or came on horseback
from the north rim into the boundary valley&mdash;the valley
between ancient <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tewa">Tewa</a> lands&mdash;into a Hidden Valley
clustered with the works of primitive Indians, the ruins
alone being capable of revealing the incidents of a buried
and hidden past. Their heads are gray now and they remember
with the semblance of tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>From 1916 until 1932, the entire area was under the
administration of the United States Forest Service of the
Department of Agriculture. At this time it was transferred
to the National Park Service, Department of the Interior.
Thousands of visitors go to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bandelier">Bandelier</a> every year chiefly just
to look at this magnificent Valley of the Frijoles. A new
modern highway replaces the old trail from the north cliff.
The visitor now drives down to the valley floor to spend an
hour or so on a tour conducted by the National Park Service,
to hear the story of how Indians lived in the cliff homes
and in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pueblo">pueblos</a> long before Columbus discovered America.
They wonder about cliff dwellers while ravens soar above
the valley floor and caw just as they did four hundred years
ago. They see the visible remains of the great <a class="gloss" href="#g_Kiva">kiva</a> on the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Canyon">Canyon</a> floor and stroll on to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Puwige">Puwige</a>, the big community
house. They view over two hundred excavated rooms, four
hundred years old. They see the narrow passage through
the east side and the remains of obstructions used to slow
down the attackers of old. And then they climb to the base
of the weathered and sun-drenched cliffs where many an
Indian woman swept rubbish from her kitchen out on to
the steep slope and ground many an ear of corn on crude
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Metate">metate</a>. Visitors climb into caves, the floors covered with
dust and ceilings still blackened with smoke. They push the
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
hands of the clock back to the Stone Age, while the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Keres">Keres</a> to
the south go on living on the banks of the muddy <a class="gloss" href="#g_RioGrande">Rio Grande</a>, apparently forgetting that there ever was a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tyuonyi">Tyuonyi</a>,
war or trouble; and while the Tewas to the north,
having settled themselves, seem to have forgotten their
ancestral home&mdash;the &ldquo;Frijoles,&rdquo; the National Park Service
strives to protect, preserve, and make the ruins in Hidden
Valley live again.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
